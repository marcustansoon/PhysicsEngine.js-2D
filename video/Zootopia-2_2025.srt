Bleh...

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,664
Blood. Blood. Blood.
And death.

3
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,331
All right. You know
what? You're milking it.

4
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,166
Besides, I think we got it.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,670
We got it up there.
Thank you, Yakkity-yak.

6
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,271
You laid it all out
beautifully.

7
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,107
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you too.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,309
It's my word against yours.

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,311
Actually...

10
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,179
<i>And I'll dart</i>
<i>every predator in Zootopia</i>

11

12
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,551
-It's your word against yours.
-Huh?

13
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:51,719
It's called a hustle,
sweetheart.

14
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:52,754
Boom.

15
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:59,627
Unlikely duo Judy Hopps,
the city's first bunny cop,

16
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,429
and Nicholas Wilde,
a small-time street fox,

17

Brian Winddancer

24
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,288

<i>during celebrations</i>

27
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,697

<i>to coexist in one city.</i>

29
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,502
This is our Zootennial!

30
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,705
And if a lowly country bunny

31
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,206
and a shifty,
likely criminal fox

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,276
can ignore
their vast, vast differences

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,580
and solve bias
and stereotype forever,

34
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:57,417
then maybe we can all
embrace our differences

35
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,187
and be better zoogether.

36
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,191
We're gonna crack a new case,
make the world a better place,

37
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,360
and be the greatest partners
of all time.

38
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,662
Hmm.

39
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,329
I mean,
we're not that different.

40
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,510
<i>At the ZPD,</i>

41

<i>partnership</i>
<i>is the cornerstone of success.</i>

42
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,383
You want to put bad guys away?

43
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,352
Be on the same page.
Every day.

44
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,623
Now today's bad guy is
this customs inspector

45
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,726
who's been smuggling
illegal overseas cargo

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,327
through the city's shipyard.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,731
Captains Hoggbottom
and Truffler will lead.

48
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,233
Higgins, Bloats, flank left.

49
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,902
Chèvre, Bûcheron, right.

50
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,270
And down the middle,
the Zebros.

51
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,205
Zebros!

52
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,608
Hopps and Wilde, I know you're
eager to prove yourselves,

53
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,410
but as rookies,
you will observe only

54
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,379
and watch the veteran teams
show you how it's...

55
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,650
Chief, hi.

56
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,885
If you're looking
for Nick and Judy,

57
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,687
they said they got it.

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,489
And they are already on site,
with their baby!

59
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,767
Are you sure this'll work?

60
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,569
You're the one that said
we needed a bust.

61
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,705
Just follow my lead, okay?
Act casual.

62
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:24,906
-Hey!
-Here we go.

63
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,273
Hello?

64
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,675
This whole area's restricted.

65
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:28,943
You can't be here.

66
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,679
Whoa. Fox and bunny. Okay.

67
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:33,881
Yes, but proud parents first.

68
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,216
-Mister...
-Inspector.

69
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,518
Inspector Snootley.

70
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,487
Inspector? What do you do?

71
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,322
Ensure that nothing illegal
gets smuggled here

72
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,925
in one of these
cargo containers?

73
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,794
That's a weird way
to ask that.

74
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,930
Anyway, you gotta leave.
You can't be here.

75
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,599
-Oh.
-Wait. Wait.

76
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,467
He's right, gosh darn it.

77
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,703
You are right, sir.

78
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:58,873
I guess we should've thought
this through. Right, babe?

79
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,309
Before we decided
to come down here

80
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,713
to this beautiful
industrial shipyard

81
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:11,485
to celebrate the big day
of our birthday boy.

82
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,321
It's his birthday?

83
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,591
Yeah. First one since...

84
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,726
...since the accident.

85
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,829
And, you know, the one thing

86
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,598
this little stinker
wished for...

87
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,033
...aside from one day
getting his tail reattached,

88
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,336
was to see a choo-choo.

89
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,774
And to maybe get a toot-toot
conductor to sign his cast.

90
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:36,911
But I'm betting
a customs inspector

91
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,278
would be even better.

92
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,881
Really?

93
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,749
All right.
For the kid. For the kid.

94
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,785
Oh, you're a saint.

95
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,286
We thank you so much.
Here you go. Either leg.

96
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,388
Or both. I don't care.

97
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,690
Maybe put a doodle on it.

98
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:50,792
Doesn't need to be perfect.

99
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,527
He's also legally blind.

100
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,734
I put a little train there
because

101
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,301
I know you like trains.

102
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,070
Come on. Come on. Come on.

103
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,639
-Just jiggle it.
-Yes. I know.

104
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,040
-Hurry!
-I got this.

105
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:06,908
Jiggle it.
Jiggle it. Jiggle it!

00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,662
The stolen van contained a
smuggled crate from overseas,

164
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:49,964
pamphlets for the Zootennial,

165
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,899
and some type of reptile skin.

166
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,634
I've already sent samples
for testing.

167
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,170
-And if you...
-What needs testing is you!

168
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,706
You two tore up half the city.

169
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,208
Because of you,
we had to call in Jumbo Unit

170
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,277
to remove a dik-dik
from a tuba!

171
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,879
<i>You're almost out.</i>
<i>You're gonna be...</i>

172
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,981
<i>No! Please, no!</i>

173
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,749
<i>Who's catching him?</i>

174
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,317
Sorry, could you show me
that clip again?

175
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,253
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

176
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,290
Did you or did you not disobey
a direct order to stand down?

177
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,958
Sir, we were in pursuit.

178
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,827
And article 6,
paragraph B states,

179
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,128
"If the lead officers
think that..."

180
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,930
You are not lead officers!

181
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,231
You're one-hit wonders

182
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,833
who should go back
to meter maiding

183
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,768
and slinging pawpsicles!

184
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,337
If I may, I think
someone's just jealous

185
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,139
that we got to drive
the squeal mobile.

186
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,842
Or maybe you thought
it was your momma.

187
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,912
Enough! Everybody out.

188
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,685
Officer Hopps,

189
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,622
despite my best efforts
to avoid it, I like you.

190
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:53,994
But this need to overdo it

191
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,598
made both of you
a headline today.

192
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,102
And it reflects badly on me,
on the department,

193
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,837
and frankly

194
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,041
on any bunny hoping
to follow in your footsteps.

195
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,846
Not every case
is going to save the world.

196
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,615
Knock-knock.

197
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,250
Hi.

198
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,718
You know, this kinda...
this sounds a lot

199
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,720
like a... just a
"you guys" conversation.

200
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,689
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go ahead and...

201
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,725
Is there a reason why you
don't take anything seriously?

202
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,060
Jokes are
a classic defense mechanism

203
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,394
for someone with
a traumatic childhood.

204
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,697
Would you like
a traumatic adulthood?

205
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,632
I would not.

206
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,067
I allowed you to work together

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,036
because you did this city
a great service.

208
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,106
But today,
you messed it all up.

209
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,175
And now, some are questioning

210
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,110
whether you should've been
partners in the first place.

211
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,678
-Sir...
-So,

212
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,947
instead of chasing
imaginary reptiles,

213
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,649
I am pulling you
from the field...

214
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:49,950
What?

215
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,318
...and giving you
a new assignment

216
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,922
reserved for special teams
like yourselves.

217
00:10:55,055 --> 00:11:00,394
Fail at this, and I will have
no choice but to split you up.

218
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,197
There will be no more
Hopps and Wilde.

219
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,334
But if you're as good
as you think you are,

220
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,271
this is your moment to shine.

221
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,943
Welcome to Partners in Crisis,

222
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,280
a workshop for duos heading
for disaster.

223
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,216
I'm your therapy animal,
Dr. Fuzzby.

224
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,118
And you are here

225
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,121
because mismatched pairings
often need a little more work

226
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,123
to make them work.

227
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,692
Greg, we talked about that.

228
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,927
What are we making Marlon?

229
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,296
Uncomfortable. Yes.

230
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,399
And, Francine,
Clark may be a mouse,

231
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,868
but he is your partner first.

232
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,005
And we have two
new "apart-ners."

233
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,174
Can you tell us
about your journey

234
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,343
to dysfunction junction?

235
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:53,714
Well, we've been official
partners for one week.

236
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,416
Happy anniversary.

237
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,118
And we're not dysfunctional
at all, actually.

238
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,321
Functioning fine.
Better than fine.

239
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,323
And we did sort of
save the city,

240
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,160
so us being here kinda seems
like a huge misunderstanding.

241
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,796
Notice how she answered first,

242
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,264
did not allow her partner
to speak,

243
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,066
seems to be
in a state of denial

244
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,968
and taps her foot when
she's suppressing discomfort.

245
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,071
And observe the source
of her discomfort

246
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,073
represented by
the disconnected affectation

247
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,141
of her emotionally
insecure partner.

248
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,177
Oh!

249
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,079
But with hard work, they'll be
on the same page by year two.

250
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,947
-Huh?
-Oh.

251
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,216
But for now, let's begin
by greeting our teammate.

252
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,851
Who would like to go first?

253
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,119
Thank you, Joel.

254
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,358
Okay, unfortunately,
Karen has chosen

255
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,828
to see Joel's smile
as a sign of aggression.

256
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,497
Hackles down, Karen.
Karen, hackles down.

257
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,866
Joel, the safe word
is "coconut."

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,034
Coconut!

259
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,305
Okay, we have to set another
meeting with the Chief.

260
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,140
Promise we'll be better.

261
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,143
Zebros!

262
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,879
You talk back less.
Maybe not at all.

263
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,349
Yeah. Or we go with my
playbook, and we just lay low.

264
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,351
We cannot prove ourselves

265
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,819
if we are stuck in that room.

266
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,154
And if we complain
to Chief Beef,

267
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,523
he'll just make us
stay longer.

268
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,357
Play it smart.
Stay off the radar.

269
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,293
And don't let it get to you.
Okay?

270
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,495
'Cause we are the dream team.

271
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,499
Sorry, Paul.

272
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,572
Roll out the red carpet.
Here's the super cops.

273
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,974
Hey, what does the fox say?

274
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,042
You suck!

275
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,276
Easy, partner.

276
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,844
Let me ask you something.

277
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,279
Do you think
we're a good team?

278
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,847
Of course.

279
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,182
I just...

280
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,884
I just wish I knew
what we had to do

281
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,787
to prove it to everyone else.

282
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,889
Or maybe we don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

283
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,192
Hmm.

284
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,529
-We do. Forever.
-Oof!

285
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:49,330
And the sooner
everyone sees

286
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,131
a fox and a bunny can be
great partners, the better.

287
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,033
Enjoy it. I got two.

288
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,868
I'd rather chew off
my own arm.

289
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,870
Happy anniversary!

290
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,046
Coconut!

291
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,214
Coconut!

292
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,375
<i>So, saw you on TV.</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

293
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,343
Everything's fine, Mom.

294
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,613
<i>Uh-oh. Everyone knows</i>
<i>"fine" is a cry for help.</i>

295
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,214
<i>You know who else</i>
<i>cried for help?</i>

296
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,216
<i>That dik-dik</i>
<i>stuck in that tuba.</i>

297
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,318
<i>Oh, him and the dik-dik. What</i>
<i>does your fox partner say?</i>

298
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:48,922
<i>Well, Nick's</i>
<i>not really a talker.</i>

299
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,458
<i>Well, you two</i>
<i>are very different.</i>

300
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,927
<i>Small-town hero</i>
<i>raised on a farm.</i>

301
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,630
<i>Big-city crook</i>
<i>raised on the streets.</i>

302
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,498
<i>I pray every day</i>

303
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,566
<i>that you'll come back home</i>
<i>and make babies.</i>

304
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,367
<i>Mom!</i>

305
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:02,035
<i>Just remember the first rule</i>
<i>of partnerships.</i>

306
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,237
<i>You can be right</i>
<i>or you can be happy.</i>

307
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,272
<i>That's true.</i>

308
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,373
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with dying a little inside</i>

309
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:07,609
<i>so you can meet in the middle.</i>

310
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,143
<i>Honey, you're pushing me out.</i>

311
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,911
<i>I wanna make sure</i>
<i>I can be seen.</i>

312
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,346
<i>Well, if she</i>
<i>could see both of us.</i>

313
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,981
-Gotta go. Work to do.
<i>-Bye, bun-bun.</i>

314
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,550
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

315
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,151
-<i>You two just need a new case.</i>
-Got it. Love you.

316
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:17,619
<i>Maybe try to find</i>
<i>that dik-dik.</i>

317
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:18,285
Bye.

318
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,399
<i>Squeal of Fortune!</i>

319
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:35,335
<i>Tomorrow's weather is,</i>
<i>again, everything.</i>

320
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,004

323
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,975
<i>Residents continue</i>
<i>to raise concerns</i>

324
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,678
<i>about the future</i>
<i>of their neighborhood.</i>

325
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,549
<i>But tonight</i>
<i>we put our differences aside</i>

326
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,483
<i>and celebrate</i>
<i>at the Zootennial gala,</i>

327
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,119
<i>where the Lynxley Journal</i>
<i>will be on display</i>

328
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,388
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in a century,</i>

329
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,090
<i>following an infamous</i>
<i>reptile attack.</i>

330
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,226
<i>The Lynxley Journal,</i>

331
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,061
<i>containing the patented</i>
<i>weather wall plans,</i>

<i>bringing the whole...</i>

334
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,215
Same catering company.

335
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,586
Mmm.

336
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,563
The Lynxley journal.

337
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,372
<i>Truth bomb!</i>

338
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:47,140
<i>The 100th anniversary</i>
<i>of the weather walls</i>

339
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,544
<i>is also the 100th anniversary</i>

340
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:52,547
<i>of Zootopia's</i>
<i>only snake attack.</i>

341
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,649
<i>The victim? A tortoise.</i>

342
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,619
<i>The Lynxley family maid</i>

343
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:00,487
<i>who was fanged while stopping</i>
<i>a venomous snake</i>

344
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,090
<i>from stealing</i>
<i>the Lynxley Journal.</i>

345
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,660
<i>No one has seen a snake</i>
<i>in Zootopia since.</i>

346
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:09,329
<i>But I'm convinced</i>
<i>one will return.</i>

347
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,131
<i>My only question is,</i>

348
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:16,370
<i>is he gonna be wearing</i>
<i>half-a-pants or one long sock?</i>

349
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,811
<i>You say, "Justice is dead."</i>

350
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,280
<i>I say, "Neigh!"</i>

351
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:27,582
<i>Ha-cha!</i>

352
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,387
Well, well,
you miss me already, huh?

353
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,789
<i>The stolen van</i>
<i>with the snake skin</i>

354
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>is from the same</i>
<i>catering company</i>

355
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,759
-<i>that's working the gala.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

356
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,459
This is you studying
your partner book?

357
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>Listen to me. Venomous snakes</i>

358
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,196
<i>tried to steal</i>
<i>the Lynxleys's journal before.</i>

359
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,098
<i>What if they're back in town</i>
<i>to steal it again?</i>

360
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,534
No snake has set foot...

361
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,303
...in Zootopia in forever,
okay?

362
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,071
Even if they had feet.

363
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,339
Look, we're already
in the hot seat, Carrots,

364
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,808
and pizza's here. Gotta go--

365
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,108
If there's a fanging
at the gala

366
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,343
and we do nothing to stop it,

367
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,211
then we are not
doing our jobs...

368
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,114
Yikes. No wonder
you never invite me over.

369
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,584
Foxes are solitary.

370
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,752
And, look, we go
and you're wrong,

371
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,119
Chief Beef will split us up.

372
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,454
And if we don't get a win soon

373
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,690
and prove
we're great partners,

374
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,457
the chief will
split us up anyway.

375
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,092
Check the perimeter.
Snoop a little.

376
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,761
We find nothing, we bail.

377
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,128
But if I'm right,

378
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,531
no one will question

379
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,432
whether you and I
belong together again.

380
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,367
We need this.

381
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,236
Fine.

382
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,272
But we'll still have
to get through security,

383
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,708
and in fancy town,
a fox and a bunny

384
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,209
won't exactly blend in. Oof!

385
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,278
That's why
we'll be undercover!

386
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,552

in the driver's seat. Whoa!

infiltrating a place

You know, this is not

Wow, that was almost
a compliment.

445
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:44,872
Your worst idea is

Yeehaw!

452
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,536
But no one is gonna steal it,

453
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,470
because we are here
to protect it.

454
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:24,045
The journal is in
the reserved section. Okay.

455
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:26,681
Come on.

456
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,448

Commando is not gonna cut it.

It's not just the clothes,
m'kay?

459

Hey, real nice humps.

Oh, is that real mink?
This is real fox.

462
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:42,864
Get invited to a lot of these?

463
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,066
Mmm. Invited? No.

464
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,702
But there's other reasons
to hob knob.

465
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,806
Madam, excuse me.
Is this yours?

466
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,406
Why, yes.

467
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,110
Well, allow me.

468
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,547
Clever fox.

469
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,481
Ooh, there!

470
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:04,518
I don't think
it has enough guards.

471
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,721
I'll get a closer look.
Watch my six.

472
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,427
Uh-oh. Bogo alert.

473

00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:27,975
Hmm.

475
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,111
Cover's made of metal.

476
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:32,813
<i>Gruffalo</i>
<i>Buffalo has joined the mix.</i>

477
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,048
<i>Three o'clock.</i>

478
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,892
-Oh! Excuse me. I am so sorry.
-Oh! Oh, no. Sorry.

479
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,827
Here, lemme just... Oh, nope.

480
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,864
That belongs to you.
I apologize.

481
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,599
Oh, gosh. He hates me.

482
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:52,600
Here.

483
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,467
Ah! You're my hero.

484
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,738
Well, just like to be prepared
for any possible scenario.

485
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,473
Which is not a weird thing
to say at a party.

486
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,944
Well, I just mopped a spill
with that guy's tail,

487
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,211
so...

488
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,579
Paw!

489
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,717
Uh, Pawbert. I am Pawbert. Hi.

490
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,152
Judy. I'm Judy Hopps.

491
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,087
Argh! What the pork?

492
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,156
Well, 'tis nice
to meet you, Judy...

493
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,792
Wait. Judy Hopps?
The Judy Hopps?

494
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,627
Are you working this?

495
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,829
I mean, you're clearly
working it.

496
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:23,631
But are you actually
working this?

497
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,866
Uh, no.
I'm actually...

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,101
Well, it's just a hunch.

499
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,469
...protecting that.

500
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,639
Good. I don't think
it has enough guards.

501
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,542
<i>Uh, that was my joke.</i>

502
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,810
Yeah, and there's
nothing here.

503
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:37,545
Let's call it a night.

504
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:38,713
Hopps?

505
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:45,920
Well, we should...

506
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:47,021
It was nice to meet you.

507
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,656
Yes, and you.

508
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:49,890
Uh, bon appétit.

509
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,993
If, at any point tonight,

510
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,493
you choose to eat,
bon appétit then.

511
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,564
You're supposed to be
off stage, Pawbert.

512
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,733
Yeah, get off stage, Pawbert.

513
00:24:58,866 --> 00:24:59,900
Wait, are you...

514
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:02,603
Yeah, I am a Lynxley.

515
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:04,071
Or, you know,
I'm trying to be.

516
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:05,206
Now, Pawbert.

517
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,640
Come on, Papi.

518
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:07,708
I got you, Pa.
Don't you worry.

519
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,543
No, I have him. I have him.

520
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:11,545
All right,
let's get this thing started.

521
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,783
Huh.

522
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,985
Welcome to
the Zootennial Gala.

523
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,721
Hey, Hopps.
I think I might actually...

524
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:22,023
I think I've got something.

525
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,191
Ah. Look at you all.

526
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,827
Good to see ya.

527
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,596
It is with great pleasure

528
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,931
that I introduce the
third-generation visionary...

529
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,267
Carrots, can you hear me?
I have a trail.

530
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,568
...who has continued

531
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:35,870
the legacy of our great city,

532
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,805
Milton Lynxley.

533
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:39,206
Thank you.

534
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,674
-Thank you very much.
-Carrots. Carrots.

535
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,178
What are you doing here?

536
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,646
Chief, she was right.

537
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,614
-You're done.
-Wait. No, no.

538
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:47,581
You're both done.

539
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,216
My grandpa had a dream

540
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,118
to build a city
for all animals.

541
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:52,920
Nick?

542
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:57,058
To truly be better together.

543
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,170
There's a snake!

544
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:10,337
Snake, snake, snake!

545
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,840
Go, bro, go.

546
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:14,809
I will remember you, zebra.

547
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:24,852
Ah!

548
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,125
Whoa!

549
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,366
Judy. Judy!

550
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:45,973
I knew it!

551
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,326
Stop!

552
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,130
Please.
You don't have to hurt him.

553
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,699
Hurt him?

554
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:16,337
Snakes never hurt anyone.

555
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,405
We aren't the bad guys.

556
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,407
They are.

557
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:26,213
And this journal holds
the secret that will prove it.

558
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:31,051
I have to prove it. Please.

559
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,257
This is our only chance
to set things right.

560
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,659
And when I do,

561
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:43,364
my family will finally
be able to come home.

562
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:44,698
Woo!

563
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,767
-Oh, no!
-I am here.

564
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,669
Hopps and Wilde...
...dream team.

565
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:51,138
We got him. Or her.

566
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:53,240
Reptiles, it's, like,
who knows?

567
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,410
The cops are right behind us.

568
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,146
Kill the snake.

569
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,748
We'll burn the journal.

570
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,185
If he wants it,
it's dangerous.

571
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:08,789
And then you two will file
a report that he attacked us,

572
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:12,459
and you will keep
your mouths shut.

573
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:16,030
Step aside.

574
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:21,702
Put out the fire!

575
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,738
-Carrots, come on.
-Help me save him.

576
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,173
-Carrots, we need--
-Nick.

577
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,475
Cold! Cold!

578
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:36,850
Chief.

579
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:38,485
He'll be okay.

580
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,854
Antivenom. He can be saved
with antivenom.

581
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,290
Hopps, what did you do?

582
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:45,092
-No, Hogg-- Hoggbottom.
-They're helping the snake.

583
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:46,493
They're trying to kill
the chief!

584
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:48,128
-Hoggbottom, no. Please.
-Backup! I need backup!

585
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:49,763
-My page. Let's go.
-Wait, wait, wait.

586
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,066
I need the journal
and probably a sweater.

587
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,902
W-whoa.

588
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,037
Cold.

589
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:01,976
-On the ground.
-Wait.

590
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,179
-Oi!
-Next time, we stay home?

591
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:06,514
Don't you move.

592
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,852
No. Stop them!

593
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:12,920
-Oi!
-Come on.

594
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,288
-Stop!
-Come on!

595
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,889
Stop!

596
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,296
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

597
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,465
Accident.
Your words, not mine.

598
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,043
Put 'em in the trunk.

599
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,957
<i>"Ter-roar" in Tundratown.</i>

600
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,859
<i>A fanging at the fiesta.</i>

601
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:53,994
A howl-a at the gala

602
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,230
as a venomous snake
attacks the founding family.

603
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,232
<i>More shocking,</i>
<i>the snake was aided</i>

604
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:01,835
<i>by embattled ZPD officers</i>
<i>Nicholas Wilde and Judy Hopps.</i>

605
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:04,271
All three now suspects
in the tragic fanging

606
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,106
<i>of Zootopia's chief of police</i>

607
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,876
<i>and considered</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

608
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,145
Chief Bogo...

609
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,013
is dead.

610
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,084
Those are words I'm glad
I don't have to say.

611
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,486
I might have to soon.

612
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,255
The doctors
are a little weirded out, but

613
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:26,060
what has happened tonight
was more than horseplay.

614
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:30,431
Hmm.

615
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,333
Uh, we, uh...

616
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,868
We're gonna take
that snake down.

617
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:38,005
And the fox and that rabbit!

618
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:42,443
Do you know how many mayors
they've already destroyed?

619
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:49,016
One, two... I got up to two.

620
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,318
Would you like to be "three"?

621
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,589
I want them gone.

622
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,892
But aren't there... laws?

623
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:04,064
I will say this once, Brian.

624
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:09,203
You will retrieve the journal
and bury them.

625
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,606
Or maybe

626
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,907
I chose the wrong mayor.

627
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,546
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

628
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,243
Hmm.

629
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,164
Hey.

630
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:12,199
The phone is the first thing
they'll track.

631
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:19,139
Sorry. I have never been on
the run from the law before.

632
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,208
Yeah. Boy.

633
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,178
It's almost like we shouldn't
have gone to that gala, huh?

634
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,046
Okie doke.
We already did it your way.

635
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,315
With Mr. Big, we do it mine.

636
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,051
This is where having
a partner from the underworld

637
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,486
is really gonna pay off.

638
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,723
Raymond! And is that Kev...

639
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:02,115
Welcome to my warehouse.

640
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,551
Oh, my God, I love your dress.

641
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,620
Oh! Thank you.

642
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,187
Fru Fru and I

643
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,457
are now equal partners
in the family business.

644
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:14,596
She brings wonderful ideas
for crime and for fashion

645
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:19,199
while I get more time to focus
on what matters most:

646
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,102
being grandpapa
to my little Judith.

647
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:23,705
Kiss my ring.

648
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,440
Kiss the stinkin' ring
right now!

649
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:27,174
You kiss it right now!
Kiss it!

650
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,009
Mwah.

651
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,578
<i>Nonno,</i> you said we were gonna

652
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:33,180
make cement shoes
for Mr. Weaselton.

653
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,148
Oh, that's my girl.

654
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,017
They grow up so fast.

655
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,186
-You shut your mouth, fox!
-You run your mouth too much!

656
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,089
Anyways, you're in trouble.

657
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,660
And we like one of yas,
so we're here to help.

658
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:48,295
New clothes. New identities.

659
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,297
Truck out of town
leaves in an hour.

660
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,567
And your meter maid cart
is taken care of.

661
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,805
I think you misunderstand.

662
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,173
We've been framed
by the lynxes.

663
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,375
And an innocent snake needs...

664
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,645
Judy, the lynxes
are killers...

665
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,814
...and they have no honor.

666
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:09,182
And this Tundratown expansion

667
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,485
only makes them
more dangerous.

668
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,757
Territorial animals will do
anything for more land.

669
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,592
So, if whatever
you're tangled up in

670
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,161
threatens their plans,
you're dead.

671
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:24,498
You don't fight the cats.
You leave.

672
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,635
Sir, I know you're trying
to look out for us.

673
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,437
But we took an oath
to protect this city.

674
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:32,272
And justice doesn't run.

675
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,741
On behalf of myself,

676
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:38,111
"Rick Wilde,"
and "Miss Trudy Cabbagepatch,"

677
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,314
we thank you for your truck
to salvation and-- Ow!

678
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,448
We cannot accept your offer.

679
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,250
We are helping that snake.

680
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,819
Boy, you're really
tossing that "we" around.

681
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,320
Snakes may have been framed

682
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:47,589
for the fanging
of that tortoise.

683
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,389
Do you have any idea why?

684
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:51,759
Or how this book
could prove it?

685
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,795
I wish I did.

686
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,229
But if it has to do
with snakes,

687
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:59,399
your best bet
is talking to a reptile.

688
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,603
Do you know any?

689
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,771
Almost no one does.

690
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:08,108
They keep to themselves,
hide out in Marsh Market.

691
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,844
But you can still find 'em.

692
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,446
You just need
a reptile expert.

693
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,882
Someone local
who knows where to go.

694
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,884
Lucky for you, I met someone.

695
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,386
She runs a podcast!

696
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,089
No, no.
Trudy Cabbagepatch,

697
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,323
Rick Wilde says no.

698
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,226
Oh, yeah!

699
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,363
If Hopps and Wilde
are on the lam,

700
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,265
subtle sleuthin' 'tis my jam.

701
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,234
Woo! Mind the splinters.

702
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,737
Oh, you called
the right beaver.

703
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,840
If you wanna talk to
a reptile, I am your gal.

704
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,675
Also, if you need to talk
to a jackalope,

705
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,578
which are real, Mom!

706
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:46,179
Excuse us. Team meeting.

707
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,649
Vetoing the beave.

708
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:50,283
New vote: All in favor
of "Truck to Being Alive

709
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,920
and Laying Low Till This
Blows Over-ville"? I mean...

710
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,922
Hopps and Wilde
do not bail on a case.

711
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,691
But she's crazy.

712
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,793
Probably lead poisoning
from eating too many pencils.

713
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:02,797
Do you know a reptile who can

714
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,331
tell us the hidden secret
in here,

715
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:05,767
or why the lynxes
framed the snakes?

716
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,704
Twenty-four hours.
Sunrise tomorrow.

717
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,739
If we strike out,
then we go into hiding,

718
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,306
and "Judy Cabbagepatch" it is.

719
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,512
It's "Trudy" Cabbagepatch,

720
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:18,913
and the safe word
is "coconut."

721
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,415
In the darkness
of a dank underpass,

722
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,950
they stepped into the vehicle,

723
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:26,453
not realizing their lives
were about to change.

724
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,656
Because we're gonna
meet a reptile?

725
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,792
Because you're about to be
best buds

726
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,761
with Nibbles Maplestick!

727
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:37,497
Takes two to tango, but
a threesome to be somethin'.

728
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:41,201
Let's find you a reptile
and romp the swamp.

729
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,278
Breathe it in!

730
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:52,780
Oh!

731
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,919
Now, if any reptile
would know

732
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,320
the secret of that book
and why the snake wants it...

733
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,289
-Hey, Johnny!
-Oh, no!

734
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,692
...it's my old lizard friend,
Jesús.

735
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:07,929
Why would a lizard
hide here?

736
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,599
Well, when Zootopia
was founded,

737
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,601
the whole neighborhood
got cut off

738
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:14,902
from the rest of the town.

739
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,470
Kinda on our own here.

740
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:19,607
Yeah, that's probably why
reptiles like it.

741
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,408
They can just do their thing.

742
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,010
Plus, it's the only place
in town

743
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,813
you can get away with
wearing a shirt and no pants.

744
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,882
Loving tour time
with Woodchuckles.

745
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,483
Great call.

746
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:30,985
-We need her.
-Oh, yeah.

747
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,252
Like a hole in the head.

748
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,489
Bad timing. Hmm.

749
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:37,725
Okay, to get to
Jesús's hideout,

750
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,392
we gotta take a ferry.

751
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:41,294
Just let me handle the locals.

752
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,598
Water folk tend to be a little
standoffish around landies.

753
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, I've been hustling
the streets since I was 12.

754
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,435
I think I can handle
a juggling seal.

755
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,437
Oh!

756
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:52,372
Sea lion.

757
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:53,708
He's not from around here.

758
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,408
But coin's a coin.

759
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:58,813
Oh, no. Change...
...is a choking hazard.

760
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,616
Well, honest mistake.

761
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,618
Do not do that!

762
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,318
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

763
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,788
Thank you, Judith.

764
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,489
Conversing with these
beautiful sea creatures

765
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,491
is like talking to anyone
a little different.

766
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:15,295
Just takes open
and respectful communication.

767
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:24,806
-Heya, bub.
-Hey, bub.

768
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:26,473
-Heya, bub, hey.
-Hey, bub, heya.

769
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,842
-Bubba, bubba, bubba.
-Bubba, bubba, bubba.

770
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,610
-Heya, bub.
-Hey, bub. Hey, bub, bub.

771
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:31,579
-Heya, bub. Bubby, bub.
-Hey, bub. Hey, bub. Hey, ho.

772
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:32,680
-Heya, bub, bub.
-Hey, bub.

773
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:34,649
Seen Jesús?

774
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:35,817
Yup.

775
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,925
And now we leave town.

776
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:52,432
Eh?

777
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,576
Thank you for this.

778
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,476
Happy anniversary.

779
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,545
Oh.

780
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,013
It's your anniversary?

781
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,350
♪ <i>This is the night</i> ♪

782
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,420
♪ <i>It's a beautiful night</i> ♪

783
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:19,359
♪ <i>And we call it bella notte</i> ♪

784
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,735
How are we gonna
find them now?

785
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:34,742
Thanks, seal.

786
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:38,713
Friend. No, no, no!

787
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:39,947
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

788
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,951
Just a little farther.

789
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:46,654
Jesús and all the answers
you'll ever need

790
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,122
are, uh, right here

791
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:51,025
at the end of this
very scary, dark hallway.

792
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,960
Boy, this is so much better

793
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:54,996
than sitting on a beach
on Outback Island,

794
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,098
sipping piña koalas.

795
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,834
Hmm. We are not skipping town

796
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:03,070
when there is an innocent
snake out there who needs us.

797
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:05,907
He's got help:
his motorcycle buddy.

798
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,642
Ah!

799
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,443
You are acting weird.
What is your problem?

800
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,580
Well, A, you railroaded me.

801
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:14,148
And B...

802
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:15,816
...if you must know,

803
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,121
I have an aversion
to reptiles.

804
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,056
What?

805
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:25,993
Oh, is my discomfort
hilarious to you?

806
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,829
No, you're... I'm sorry.
You're right, we are partners.

807
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,564
And whenever
I'm uncomfortable,

808
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:32,800
you are always very
considerate of my feelings.

809
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,001
Look out! Snake skin!

810
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,469
-Ow!
-I'm slipping!

811
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:37,972
I'm slipping! Hold the rail!

812
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,472
-I'm holding the rail.
-Hold it. Hold it.

813
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:40,608
-Stop pulling my ears!
-Hold the rail.

814
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,076
Never pull a bunny's ears!

815
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:42,843
-Hold the rail.
-Never pull a bunny's ears!

816
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:47,648
I think the real mystery

817
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,717
is how you two
ever solved anything.

818
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,921
Anyhoo, let's see what Jesús
has to say about your journal.

819
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:56,657
Oh, and if he offers you food,
accept.

820
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,492
Declining is a sign
of disrespect,

821
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:00,695
to all of them.

822
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:02,163
"All of them"?

823
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:14,608
Ha!

824
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:27,487
Order up.

825
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,257
Hey, another drink.

826
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:38,599
So warm.

827
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,633
Gah!

828
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,603
Whoops.

829
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:43,771
No!

830
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,108
Keep it.

831
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,180
Jesús!

832
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:54,915
Allow me to introduce
my friends.

833
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,817
This is Judith and Nicholas.

834
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,185
They are wanted fugitives

835
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,720
investigating a snake mystery

836
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:01,022
and trying
not to get murdered.

837
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,656
May we sit?

838
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:06,961
Oh. Okay.

839
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,137
Oh, I'm good,
but these guys look hungry.

840
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:22,143
Thank you for meeting with us.

841
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,079
We believe snakes were framed
for something in this journal,

842
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:29,016
-perhaps pertaining to...
-Eat first, talk second.

843
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:30,317
Oh.

844
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,277
Uh...

845
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,988
Hey, guys. They ate it!

846
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:11,092
Look at their faces.

847
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:12,726
I don't eat grubs.

848
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,795
<i>Hermano,</i> get me a scone!

849
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:17,865
Okay, okay.

850
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,000
Hmm.

851
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,203
Metal cover.

852
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,872
And what does that mean?

853
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,040
It means

854
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,342
it's fancy.

855
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:32,313
It also means
the secret you're looking for

856
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,949
is probably
right on the cover.

857
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:37,952
Somehow vipers can see things
in the metal,

858
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:39,920
even under the paint.

859
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:43,124
This is Ebenezer Lynxley's
original journal

860
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,692
for the weather walls.

861
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:48,162
Why would he hide a secret
for a snake?

862
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:50,131
I don't know.

863
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:53,968
But it must have been big,
'cause a tortoise died for it.

864
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:57,371
I am guessing
that it was a slow death.

865
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:05,079
The fanging didn't just change
how folks saw snakes.

866
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:08,149
No mammals trusted
any reptile after that.

867
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:12,386
That's why we all left.

868
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,988
And that's when the Lynxleys

869
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,957
expanded Tundratown
the first time.

870
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,394
And it's happening again.

871
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:23,797
The expansion is going here.

872
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,302
Marsh Market
will be buried in snow.

873
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,171
We'll all get pushed out.

874
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,908
Those lynxes
will get more land,

875
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,810
and there's no way
to stop 'em.

876
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:46,020
What if the secret
hidden in here could?

877
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,289
Then I would say

878
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:53,227
holding it puts the two of you
in grave danger.

879
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:57,064
Ooh.

880
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,036
They tracked you?

881
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:03,871
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

882
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:05,706
Whoops.

883
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:09,710
It's the ZPD!

884
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:12,213
Run!

885
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:13,747
Leave the tails!

886
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,316
Follow me. Come on!

887
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:20,054
Wait. Why are you helping us?

888
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:22,156
You two saved the city once.

889
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,358
I reckon you can
save it again.

890
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,260
And when you do,

891
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:30,030
maybe everyone will see
we ain't that different.

892
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:35,336
Huh.

893
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,005
-Freeze!
-Yeah, freeze!

894
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,274
I'm really sorry. But this is

895
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,809
my family's only chance
to come home.

896
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,010
Wait. We wanna help.

897
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:44,445
Wait. Wait.

898
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,314
Come back!

899
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:49,283
There's no path.
Take the docks!

900
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,417
Wha-- Carrots!

901
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,319
Wait! We believe you!

902
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:53,887
Nick! Come on! Come on!

903
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,197
Ow!

904
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:06,534
Grab it!

905
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:13,474
Hey!

906
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,043
I got eyes on them.
They're heading for the tubes!

907
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:17,344
In pursuit.

908
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,229
Hey, bubba.

909
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:36,297
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

910
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,164
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

911
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:38,499
Go!

912
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:40,367
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

913
00:46:40,502 --> 00:46:41,435
-Bub-bye.
-Hey, Bub.

914
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:42,269
-Bub-bye.
-Bub-bye.

915
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:43,370
Bub-bye. Bye.

916
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:44,972
-Hey, bub.
-Bub-bye.

917
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:54,948
Pro tip! If he goes
for the red line,

918
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,884
do not follow!

919
00:46:57,017 --> 00:46:59,253
You will run out of air!

920
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:01,455
Good luck! I love you!

921
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,061
Sorry.

922
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:10,164
Cannonball!

923
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,468
That's a red line. Red line!

924
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,937
You're going to run out
of air! Coconut! Coconut!

925
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,393
Anything you need, I got 'em.

926
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,295
Sequels, prequels, requels.

927
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:43,230
Who says the industry's
going down the tubes?

928
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,251
Are you okay?

929
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:39,286
Yeah. Yes.

930
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,021
Uh, you?

931
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,190
I... Well, I've...

932
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,359
I feel like some...

933
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:48,228
some "sorries," uh,
may be in order.

934
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:51,265
Nick, it's okay.

935
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:54,101
I know you didn't want to
lose him on purpose.

936
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:57,705
Oh, not me sorry. No, no.

937
00:48:58,038 --> 00:48:59,173
You sorry.

938
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,444
Well, now we kinda have
no way to find him

939
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:04,646
or stop the lynxes,

940
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:06,714
so agree to disagree.

941
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:09,049
But...

942
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:10,518
we are alive.

943
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,053
So if we can't find him,
that's great.

944
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:15,989
What we can find
is a truck out of here.

945
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:17,191
Gah.

946
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,973
Box of old matches. Helpful.

947
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:37,077
Trudy Cabbagepatch,
leaving town. We're done.

948
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:39,346
Yodelayheehoo!

949
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,516
Ah, dis is veird place
for you to be.

950
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:42,750
<i>Ja,</i> very veird.

951
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,586
Ach, zey fell out of ze tube.

952
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,521
Okay, ve vill call police
to help!

953
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:48,222
Nope! No, no, we're fine.

954
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,357
Yep, we were
just leaving town.

955
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:53,561
Actually, um,
do you happen to know

956
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:55,563
where this tube goes?

957
00:49:55,697 --> 00:49:57,331
-Oh, Copenhoofen.
<i>-Ja, ist Copenhoofen.</i>

958
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:58,733
Got it. Thank y--

959
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:02,169
Oh, you chew too much.
This is not okay!

960
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,407
Huh.

961
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,544
Where did... Where did
you find these flowers?

962
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:10,778
Oh, the Liebenflower?

963
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:12,479
Ze tippity-top of ze mountain.

964
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:13,748
Uh, zis is ze only place
zey grow.

965
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,249
Oh, boy.

966
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,584
Is...

967
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:20,187
Uh, is there anything else
up there?

968
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,055
-Nope, there sure isn't.
-Oh, <i>ja.</i>

969
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:23,591
Old Honeymoon Lodge.

970
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:26,260
But is closed for long time.
Was hideout for snakes.

971
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,097
Honeymoon Lodge.

972
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,431
How...

973
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,100
How do you reach it?

974
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,469
Oh, tourists take ze tram
from Copenhoofen,

975
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:38,573
but ze rope is faster.

976
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:41,543
Good luck! Have fun
at ze Honeymoon Lodge!

977
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:42,710
Thank you!

978
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,652
What does the secret

979
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:53,086
have to do with
the reptiles leaving town?

980
00:50:54,822 --> 00:50:56,758
How did it get hidden in the
journal in the first place?

981
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:58,693
Will you slow down?

982
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:02,630
How long do you think
it's going to be

983
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:04,599
before Hoggbottom and the ZPD
figure out where we are?

984
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:07,635
If anything,
we should be going faster.

985
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,404
As I always say...

986
00:51:10,538 --> 00:51:13,340
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

987
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:14,274
Nick...

988
00:51:15,543 --> 00:51:17,344
<i>I-- I-- I-- I-- I really am</i>

989
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,279
<i>ju-- dumb-- dumb-- dumb--</i>
<i>dumb-- dumb-- dumb bunny.</i>

990
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,181
<i>Just dumb-- dumb-- dumb--</i>
<i>dumb-- dumb-- dumb bunny.</i>

991
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:24,519
This was a gift
to symbolize our partnership,

992
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,087
and it is not appropriate
for this moment.

993
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,590
Oh, no, I was just...

994
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:30,357
...hoping to jot down
some ideas

995
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,527
for what we will put
on our tombstones.

996
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,429
I'll start.
"His partner did it."

997
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:37,164
What happened to you

998
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:38,265
that you can't just have
a normal conversation?

999
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:42,570
I will save that
for my therapy animal.

1000
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,505
Yeah,

1001
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,206
-you need a therapy animal.
-Oh, yeah.

1002
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,777
Well, you need
a herd of therapy animals.

1003
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:54,147
Yeah. You need a whole
migration of therapy animals.

1004
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:28,850
Carrots?

1005
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,233
Hmm.

1006
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:12,927
Hey, Carrots?

1007
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:20,601
Huh.

1008
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:23,571
Ew.

1009
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:52,900
Uh, Carrots?

1010
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:55,368
Ugh.

1011
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:00,407
Huh?

1012
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,776
Carrots!

1013
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:33,641
There was a whole
reptile neighborhood.

1014
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,545
Their home...

1015
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:42,449
The lynxes just erased it.

1016
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,552
This is what they do.

1017
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,821
We have to go.

1018
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:50,625
They push animals out with
lies so they can have more.

1019
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,359
We gotta go.
Carrots, we gotta go!

1020
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:53,293
That's what
the snake's trying to prove.

1021
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:54,962
The ZPD is here.

1022
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,531
What?

1023
00:54:56,664 --> 00:54:58,533
No one will believe us.
Not without proof.

1024
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:00,968
Leave it. They aren't gonna
just arrest us.

1025
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,069
The lynxes want us dead.

1026
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:03,871
We need it to solve the case.

1027
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:06,574
-Judy, just...
-We have to solve the case.

1028
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:08,408
-Nick...
-I don't care about the case!

1029
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:12,814
Judy,
it's not worth dying for.

1030
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,485
The world will never be
a better place

1031
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,454
if no one is brave enough
to do the right thing.

1032
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,356
The world is what it is,
Carrots,

1033
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,727
and sometimes being a hero...

1034
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:30,631
it just doesn't
make a difference.

1035
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:39,073
I think, uh...

1036
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:44,344
I think maybe...

1037
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:45,613
maybe we...

1038
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:49,917
are different.

1039
00:56:11,706 --> 00:56:12,773
Mmm.

1040
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:26,854
Oh, my gosh,
I think I just took out a cop.

1041
00:56:26,988 --> 00:56:28,522
Uh. Sorry, sir!

1042
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:30,892
-Pawbert?
-Yeah. It's, uh... you know...

1043
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:33,527
-We're the good guys!
-I told you she's helping.

1044
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,735
Come with us.

1045
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:43,104
-Ow.
-We have the fox.

1046
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:45,773
We have the fox!

1047
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:47,541
They already have
your partner.

1048
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:50,678
They can't get you too.

1049
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:53,014
Please. We can stop my family.

1050
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:09,096
Judy!

1051
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,065
No, no, no!

1052
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,802
I got you.

1053
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,086
All right. Here we go.

1054
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:46,968
What?

1055
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,046
Huh.

1056
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:02,482
You're not dead!

1057
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:04,518
She's not dead!

1058
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:06,554
Sorry, sorry.

1059
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,488
I just got
my motorcycle license.

1060
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:12,827
Nick?

1061
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:14,929
They, uh...

1062
00:58:15,663 --> 00:58:16,931
They caught him.

1063
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:24,071
But out here,
no one's gonna catch us.

1064
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:30,911
Mayor Winddancer.

1065
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:38,853
Where's the bunny?

1066
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:40,955
I don't know.

1067
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:42,990
But, you know, she's a rabbit.

1068
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:44,992
So maybe you can
pull her out of your hat.

1069
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:47,661
I'm not wearing a hat.

1070
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,996
He's messing with you, sir.

1071
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,098
I knew that.
Get him out of here.

1072
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,601
No.

1073
00:58:57,638 --> 00:59:00,141
Where are they, Mr. Wilde?

1074
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:04,745
Begin the expansion.

1075
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:06,280
Freeze Marsh Market.

1076
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:08,182
-Flush everyone out.
-What? No, you can't--

1077
00:59:08,315 --> 00:59:13,854
Water folk, like foxes,
are lesser mammals.

1078
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:16,991
If I say they helped
a dangerous snake,

1079
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,326
no one will care what we do.

1080
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:24,165
You're going
to a dark cell, Mr. Wilde.

1081
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:27,268
Just long enough
to read the headline

1082
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,703
of your partner's demise.

1083
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:35,976
You should've left town
when you had the chance.

1084
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:46,587
Dad.

1085
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,723
Fur from whoever's helping
the bunny and the snake.

1086
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,161
Find Pawbert.

1087
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,265
Almost to me hideout.

1088
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,901
Snake in the hole.

1089
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:01,836
Ooh. Yeah, yeah.

1090
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,003
Oh!

1091
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,039
Oh!

1092
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:07,241
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

1093
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:11,145
We'll stop the Lynxleys
and save your partner.

1094
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,314
I'm sorry. You are...

1095
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,983
Oh. Gary. Gary the Snake.

1096
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:17,618
And your last name?

1097
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:18,886
De'Snake.

1098
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:21,322
Everything is gonna be okay.

1099
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:33,834
Teaming up
with you is very exciting.

1100
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,904
Ooh! Uh,
don't worry about my fang.

1101
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:39,373
I got my own anti-venom pen.

1102
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:41,242
Stops the toxin.

1103
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,110
<i>Stab me</i>
<i>straight into the heart.</i>

1104
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:50,284
Welcome to my oasis...

1105
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,319
...away from my evil family.

1106
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:54,955
I like to come here,
just kind of veg out.

1107
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:56,257
Ooh!

1108
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,392
-Get with all my cat stuff.
-Wow.

1109
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:01,061
-No! That's actually vintage.
-Awesome.

1110
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:02,863
No!
If you could just not.

1111
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:04,665
-Ooh!
-No! No, please don't.

1112
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:05,933
-Wow!
-Oh, my gosh.

1113
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,201
-Mammals get the best stuff.
-No.

1114
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,802
-What's this do?
-Wait, not that.

1115
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,940
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

1116
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:18,379
So, we should probably
get to the journal, hmm?

1117
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:21,415
How did you become partners?

1118
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,450
Oh, when I found out
the journal

1119
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:25,452
was going to be
on display at the Gala,

1120
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:29,123
I sent his family an anonymous
letter asking to see it.

1121
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:32,259
Luckily, they make Pawbert
work in the mail room,

1122
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,328
so he read it first.

1123
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,031
I got him smuggled in
from overseas.

1124
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,233
Seven days in a crate.

1125
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:42,903
But if I fix things for
my family, it'll be worth it.

1126
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:46,173
Then we'll fix things
for your partner too.

1127
01:01:50,444 --> 01:01:52,246
Hey.

1128
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:55,349
I know coming with us
was hard,

1129
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,419
but we're gonna
help your partner,

1130
01:01:58,553 --> 01:02:00,988
the same way
we're gonna help the city.

1131
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:06,227
We stop my family
and show everyone the truth.

1132
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,295
Are you ready?

1133
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,364
Light the fire.

1134
01:02:19,574 --> 01:02:22,510
How much do you know?

1135
01:02:22,843 --> 01:02:26,447
Well, uh, that his family
was framed,

1136
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:29,283
and there's some secret
hidden in the metal cover

1137
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:32,453
that only a snake can see.

1138
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:37,858
Not just any snake,
a heat-sensing pit viper.

1139
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:41,795
All it takes
is a little warmth.

1140
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:45,966
I just... I don't understand.

1141
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,068
Why would
your great-grandfather

1142
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:50,204
hide a secret for a snake?

1143
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:52,840
He didn't.

1144
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:54,441
I...

1145
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:59,313
It wasn't his journal.

1146
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:03,250
That's the secret.

1147
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:06,521
<i>Zootopia wasn't created</i>
<i>by a mammal.</i>

1148
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:11,025
<i>It was created by a snake.</i>

1149
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,360
<i>Gary's great-grandmother.</i>

1150
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:17,097
<i>She wanted to make the city</i>
<i>a place</i>

1151
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,967
<i>where all animals</i>
<i>felt welcome.</i>

1152
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:25,039
<i>So she invented</i>
<i>her weather walls</i>

1153
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:27,374
<i>to help everyone.</i>

1154
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:35,082
<i>She just needed an investor.</i>

1155
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:37,418
<i>A partner.</i>

1156
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,121
<i>But when my great-grandfather</i>

1157
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:43,558
<i>saw what her idea</i>
<i>could be worth...</i>

1158
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:51,031
<i>he plotted to steal her plans</i>
<i>for himself.</i>

1159
01:03:57,505 --> 01:03:59,574
<i>So he committed a murder...</i>

1160
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:04,211
<i>his own maid...</i>

1161
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:08,982
<i>and framed</i>
<i>Gary's great-grandmother.</i>

1162
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,986
<i>And because she was a snake,</i>

1163
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:15,623
<i>everyone believed his lie.</i>

1164
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:22,296
<i>Soon, no reptiles</i>
<i>were welcome.</i>

1165
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,965
<i>And over time,</i>

1166
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:26,501
<i>my great-grandfather</i>

1167
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:31,939
<i>buried the reptile</i>
<i>neighborhood in snow.</i>

1168
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:40,447
<i>And he died believing no one</i>
<i>could ever uncover his crimes.</i>

1169
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:42,550
<i>But...</i>

1170
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:46,954
<i>he was wrong.</i>

1171
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:52,960
<i>Her original patent was saved.</i>

1172
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:55,663
<i>That's what</i>
<i>you're looking for.</i>

1173
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:57,532
<i>She hid it in her home.</i>

1174
01:04:58,499 --> 01:05:02,302
<i>Find her home,</i>
<i>find her patent.</i>

1175
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:14,047
We just didn't know
where her home was buried

1176
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:17,484
until now.

1177
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:20,655
My family's land?

1178
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:26,093
But under all that snow,
how are we gonna find it?

1179
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:27,461
Wait.

1180
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:29,129
Clock tower.

1181
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,298
Her neighborhood,
the reptile neighborhood,

1182
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:32,499
had a clock tower.

1183
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:34,334
It lights up like a beacon.

1184
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:37,705
If it wasn't fully buried,
maybe we could see it.

1185
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:39,473
Follow it to her home.

1186
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:41,442
Except my great-grandfather
turned off the power.

1187
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,110
But we have the plans

1188
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:45,012
that show us
how to turn it back on.

1189
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:47,047
Oh! Ooh! Hmm.

1190
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,450
The power switch
to her whole neighborhood

1191
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:52,286
was in the original
control room.

1192
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:54,988
All right! And where is that?

1193
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,624
Inside the oldest wall
of the city.

1194
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,193
The Desert Tundratown
weather wall.

1195
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:02,296
We get inside,
turn on that switch,

1196
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,731
light the clock tower,

1197
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:07,968
-we find her house.
-We find her patent.

1198
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,171
And my family
is finally coming home.

1199
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:13,373
We will succeed, Judy Hopps.

1200
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:16,443
We shall succeed!

1201
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,113
I found him.

1202
01:06:21,783 --> 01:06:23,283
Get me Hoggbottom.

1203
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:31,158
Ooh! It's Nicholas Wilde.
Big-time cop, huh?

1204
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,661
I'll see you
at the lunch table.

1205
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:36,363
I'm gonna tie your tail
in a knot.

1206
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:37,599
Hoggbottom--

1207
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,501
What are you looking at,
butthead?

1208
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,336
This is a mistake.
It's a setup. It's the lynxes.

1209
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,037
Listen to me. Please.

1210
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,741
I know we have had
our differences, right?

1211
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:49,677
But I've always
respected you--

1212
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:53,113
You don't respect anyone.

1213
01:06:55,148 --> 01:06:57,384
Phone. It's Milton Lynxley.

1214
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:59,521
He's got
the rabbit's location.

1215
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:02,122
Whatever he says,
it's a lie, Hoggbottom.

1216
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:03,658
Hoggbottom, listen to me!

1217
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,759
Oh, God.

1218
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:12,032
Nicholas Wilde!

1219
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:16,169
What are the chances?

1220
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:19,239
You know, this is
my first time in prison,

1221
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:20,642
and I gotta say,

1222
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:23,310
their food is on point.

1223
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:25,747
How are you even here?

1224
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,180
Destiny.

1225
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,383
Plus an arrest.

1226
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,485
But it looks like
Judith got away.

1227
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,623
Was that decision mutual?

1228
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:37,357
Oh.

1229
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:40,595
Sensing trouble in paradise.
Wanna talk about it?

1230
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,063
What I want
is to get out of here.

1231
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:44,566
Right, your big plan.

1232
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,735
Lay low on Outback Island
sipping piña koalas.

1233
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:50,638
Except you can't trust koalas,
'cause they got four thumbs.

1234
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:53,140
Did a whole episode about it
on my podcast.

1235
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:55,810
It was called
"They Got Four Thumbs."

1236
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,111
But you know what? At least
they ain't platypuses.

1237
01:07:58,245 --> 01:07:59,413
Wait. Can you just...

1238
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:01,516
Can you please
just let me concentrate?

1239
01:08:01,649 --> 01:08:02,717
Roger that.

1240
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,157
Just talk to me, dude!

1241
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:13,393
What's the last thing
she said to you?

1242
01:08:14,662 --> 01:08:16,129
She, um...

1243
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:22,235
Uh, she said
maybe we are too different.

1244
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,805
Hmm.

1245
01:08:23,938 --> 01:08:26,774
And what did you say
before that?

1246
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:29,242
I said the case
isn't worth dying for.

1247
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,344
Mmm.

1248
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,412
Like, uh...

1249
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:37,150
like, you know, as in it isn't
worth her dying for because...

1250
01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:41,355
because solitary animals
like me

1251
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,124
don't have real friends.

1252
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:48,596
And I... I...
I don't want to lose her.

1253
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,566
So, I just...

1254
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,702
I don't know how to say that.

1255
01:08:57,639 --> 01:08:59,741
You know what, bud?
I think you just did.

1256
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,275
Wait, how'd you do that?

1257
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:04,144
Well, I opened my arms,

1258
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,814
put them around you
and then I squeezed.

1259
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:10,384
It's called a hug.
Do foxes not have hugs?

1260
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:12,285
Oh!

1261
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:14,656
The lock.
Yeah, that's Beave 101.

1262
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:16,758
The rabbit's in Desert Dunes.

1263
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:17,825
Roll out!

1264
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,493
Hit it. Roll out!

1265
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:21,596
Your partner needs you,

1266
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:24,264
and Nibbles Maplestick
is gonna get you to her.

1267
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:29,937
Hey! It's the fox dad!
And the woodchuck!

1268
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,640
Woodchuck? I'm a beaver!
Call me that again--

1269
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:33,941
Oops.

1270
01:09:34,274 --> 01:09:35,910
Okay, go! We gotta go!
Here we go!

1271
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:38,178
Get back here!

1272
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,783
Hello, Nicholas.

1273
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,518
I hope you like my new home.

1274
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:45,853
I wove it with my own wool.

1275
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,188
Jump scare!

1276
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:53,861
<i>Adios!</i>

1277
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:59,399
Ooh-whee!

1278
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:06,641
We're free!

1279
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:10,477
-Huh.
-Wheels. We need wheels.

1280
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:13,280
No, no.

1281
01:10:13,413 --> 01:10:14,682
No, no, no, no.

1282
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,450
I am sorry.

1283
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:19,252
I do not think we can
get to Judy in time to help.

1284
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,822
Unless...

1285
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:23,356
...you happen to know
the fastest driver

1286
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,392
in the history of Zootopia.

1287
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:44,712
Hey, Flash,
Flash Hundred Yard Dash.

1288
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:45,980
Partner's in trouble.

1289
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:47,447
Need to get across town,
ignore the laws.

1290
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:48,850
No...

1291
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:52,754
problem.

1292
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:54,655
Let's hit it.

1293
01:10:56,824 --> 01:10:58,325
Hey.

1294
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:00,327
-Glad you're here.
-I gotta tell ya,

1295
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,764
I'm not convinced
a sloth is our most reliable--

1296
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:06,701
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1297
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,304
To turn on the clock tower,

1298
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:12,439
and light the way
to your great-grandma's home

1299
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:14,041
so we can find her patent,

1300
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:16,778
we need to reach the power
control room through here.

1301
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:18,012
But we have to move quickly
or we're never--

1302
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,615
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

1303
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:22,282
Look, Gary,
if we don't over-prepare,

1304
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:24,351
we're underprepared
and I don't...

1305
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:26,821
My family's
been trying to prove

1306
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:28,523
we're not what everyone thinks

1307
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:30,024
for a hundred years.

1308
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:33,027
But even this close,
they'd never want me

1309
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,963
to put the weight of the world
on my shoulders.

1310
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:38,633
Because I don't have
any shoulders.

1311
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:42,435
We shall succeed.

1312
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:48,308
I got you, rabbit.

1313
01:11:51,512 --> 01:11:52,947
I cannot help Judy
if I don't know where she is,

1314
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,849
which is why I need you
to get on Paul's computer

1315
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,483
<i>and track Hoggbottom.</i>

1316
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,085
You are an escaped fugitive.

1317
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:00,621
I could get fired
for even talking to you.

1318
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:02,924
They're gonna put her
to sleep! Do it!

1319
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,091
Okay!

1320
01:12:05,693 --> 01:12:06,794
Hmm.

1321
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:08,896
Did you try restarting it?
Mm-hmm.

1322
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,397
Have you tried
not being an idiot?

1323
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:12,867
Hey, Paul.
I got you some donuts.

1324
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,434
Oh!

1325
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:15,903
-Oh, no!
-Thanks, Clawhauser.

1326
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:18,471
<i>Clawhauser! Location!</i>

1327
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:23,343
Oh, no.

1328
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,546
I think we're gonna have to
go through the festival.

1329
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,814
Festival?

1330
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,387
The phone's
the first thing they track.

1331
01:12:34,522 --> 01:12:36,356
Go! Go!

1332
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:41,696
-Clawhauser!
-I am working on it.

1333
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,365
-I got it! No!
-<i>Great, great, great. Now--</i>

1334
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:57,912
Oh. What festival is this?

1335
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:02,650
Yeah!

1336
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:07,955
Move, move, move!

1337
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:13,527
-Come on!
-Go, go, go!

1338
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:16,396
We are with you, Judy Hopps.

1339
01:13:17,798 --> 01:13:18,699
Ha-ha!

1340
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,802
We meet again, Zebra.

1341
01:13:23,838 --> 01:13:25,673
-Here come the horns!
-Ow!

1342
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,012
She's going for the door.
She's going for the door!

1343
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,147
<i>Clawhauser, we're out of time.</i>

1344
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,850
I got it!

1345
01:13:35,983 --> 01:13:37,718
Desert Tundratown weather wall
access door.

1346
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:40,121
Desert Tundratown weather wall
access door. Hurry!

1347
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:43,691
-What is in that wall?
-Power control room.

1348
01:13:43,824 --> 01:13:46,827
But for, like,
some old part of Tundratown.

1349
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:49,964
I know what they're
doing. They'll ruin us.

1350
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:55,102
<i>No more tranquilizers.</i>

1351
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:56,469
<i>Put them down.</i>

1352
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:59,140
-Sir.
-Put them down. Now!

1353
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,578
<i>Take the shot.</i>

1354
01:14:04,712 --> 01:14:07,515
<i>Take the shot! Do it!</i>

1355
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:09,784
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

1356
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:36,844
Judy!

1357
01:14:41,716 --> 01:14:44,018
-Snake!
-Power control room?

1358
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:46,087
Uh, five flights up.
Come on, hurry!

1359
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,657
That is a lot of stairs.

1360
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:53,027
Way to hustle, bud, I love ya!
I owe ya!

1361
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:57,531
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's
turning on. It's turning on!

1362
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,736
No. Nibbles?

1363
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:06,907
Nibbles!

1364
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:10,778
Snake!

1365
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:12,213
Cold!

1366
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:14,915
It's jammed.

1367
01:15:15,049 --> 01:15:18,219
Don't worry about me.
Find the switch.

1368
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:19,887
No, no, no, no. Not these.

1369
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,623
It would be, uh... older.

1370
01:15:38,873 --> 01:15:40,775
Can you see it?

1371
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:43,244
Did we turn on the clock
tower?

1372
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:48,149
There!

1373
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:50,151
It's there!

1374
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:57,291
We did it? We can find
the original patent?

1375
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,828
Nick?

1376
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:02,997
The door... It's locked...
We have to...

1377
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,231
How did it lock?

1378
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:06,767
Nibbles? Open it.

1379
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:09,336
Nibbles!

1380
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,973
Dang door stuck on me.

1381
01:16:14,175 --> 01:16:15,576
Sorry.

1382
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:18,112
Last case
there was kind of a twist.

1383
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:19,680
I know.

1384
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:25,152
Oh, my gosh.
I really...

1385
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:27,621
Oh, my heart is pounding.

1386
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:29,323
I thought you knew.
I thought you knew.

1387
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:30,891
-No.
-Whoa.

1388
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:33,260
Sorry, partner.

1389
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,831
Hate to leave you
out in the cold...

1390
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:39,033
...but I'm gonna.

1391
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:42,603
Please don't be mad at me.

1392
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:45,606
But, I mean, you get it.

1393
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:48,976
We've always been
on the same page. Me and you!

1394
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,078
Underdogs, right?

1395
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:54,281
You gotta prove you're as good
as everyone else.

1396
01:16:54,415 --> 01:16:56,617
That you belong.

1397
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,353
I know,
it's messed up...

1398
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:02,089
...but this is my chance.

1399
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:04,191
I have to take it.

1400
01:17:04,325 --> 01:17:07,061
'Cause when I get
to his great-grandma's home,

1401
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:09,864
and I burn
the original patent,

1402
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:12,700
I'll finally be something
in my family.

1403
01:17:13,701 --> 01:17:15,936
And I'll finally belong too.

1404
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,338
<i>Judy?</i>

1405
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,207
Ruh-roh.

1406
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:21,775
<i>Carrots?</i>

1407
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:27,781
No loose ends.

1408
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,318
Bye, partner.

1409
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:36,123
Bye, Judy Hopps.

1410
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,429
Pawbert. Please.

1411
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:45,866
You can be different
than your family.

1412
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:49,436
I don't want to be different.

1413
01:17:52,806 --> 01:17:54,742
Nick...

1414
01:17:57,044 --> 01:17:58,746
Judy?

1415
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:07,321
Judy?

1416
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,323
Nibbles, do you see her?

1417
01:18:09,456 --> 01:18:11,292
No, nothing yet.

1418
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:13,794
Judy.

1419
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:16,096
Nick.

1420
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,898
Ni...

1421
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:23,237
We shall succeed,

1422
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:25,072
Judy Hopps.

1423
01:18:30,978 --> 01:18:33,147
It's okay. Judy sent me.

1424
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,282
She needs to find Nick.

1425
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:40,154
Yep.
Should've seen that coming.

1426
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:45,492
Judy!

1427
01:18:48,095 --> 01:18:49,897
Nick.

1428
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:55,903
We... shall... succeed.

1429
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:00,140
Judy...

1430
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:04,745
I can't move.

1431
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:10,918
And you're too cold to help.

1432
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:13,454
<i>And he's gonna...</i>

1433
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,390
<i>Nick's gonna...</i>

1434
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:18,459
<i>Judy...</i>

1435
01:19:18,593 --> 01:19:22,830
<i>The world was</i>
<i>never meant to be</i>

1436
01:19:22,963 --> 01:19:26,233
<i>on one animal's shoulders.</i>

1437
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:34,174
That's why
my great-grandma wanted

1438
01:19:34,308 --> 01:19:39,346
Zootopia to be for everyone.

1439
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:45,152
So, we could all help each
other.

1440
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,290
I didn't help.

1441
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:52,793
<i>You did.</i>

1442
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:57,798
You chose to help me

1443
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:05,906
and became
my best warm-blooded friend.

1444
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:13,080
Very warm.

1445
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,959
Permission to hug?

1446
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:47,081
We're gonna save you
and save your friend.

1447
01:20:47,214 --> 01:20:49,584
Judy!

1448
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:51,318
Hey, he's gonna eat
that rabbit!

1449
01:20:51,452 --> 01:20:53,287
No, wait!
I'm saving her!

1450
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,622
I'm gonna get her
the anti-pen.

1451
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:56,256
Where is she?

1452
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:59,159
She...
She didn't make it.

1453
01:21:00,595 --> 01:21:03,997
But with snake bites,
you go fast.

1454
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:06,400
You'll see.

1455
01:21:16,343 --> 01:21:18,145
No.

1456
01:21:23,585 --> 01:21:27,187
She's gone, Nick.
Just get it over with!

1457
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,236
You're done.

1458
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:45,406
Know when to quit!

1459
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,274
Anti-venom!

1460
01:21:47,408 --> 01:21:50,377
You can save her with the
anti-venom! Throw me the bag!

1461
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:53,147
Judy!

1462
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:12,466
Leave it!
You're gonna kill us both.

1463
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:15,269
It's not worth dying for.

1464
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:19,006
Agree to disagree.

1465
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:32,286
<i>Stab me</i>
<i>straight into the heart.</i>

1466
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:05,385
-I thought... He told me you...
-I was trying to get to you.

1467
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,087
-And I saw you...
-...that you were...

1468
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:13,227
I'll help your friend.

1469
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,331
Okay. I don't care
that we're different.

1470
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:19,132
You know? I...

1471
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:22,436
What I care about is you.

1472
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,338
I care about you.

1473
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,140
Okay?

1474
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,177
And I didn't say it.

1475
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:32,379
I should've said it.

1476
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:33,648
But I didn't

1477
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:35,550
because...

1478
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:38,520
uh, well...

1479
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:41,321
...'cause I am
an emotionally insecure

1480
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:44,124
source of your discomfort,

1481
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:47,094
who's not good
at expressing his feelings.

1482
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,532
Probably because I've been
on my own my whole life.

1483
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:52,232
It's not an excuse.
It's just...

1484
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,769
It's why instead
of telling you

1485
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:58,105
that you're the best thing
that ever happened to me,

1486
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:01,141
I-I make jokes
about your ears.

1487
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:02,710
And-And I tell you
that you try too hard,

1488
01:24:02,844 --> 01:24:04,579
when, you know, the truth is

1489
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:07,749
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

1490
01:24:07,882 --> 01:24:10,183
Because...

1491
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:12,587
Because no one else
in the world

1492
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,523
matters more to me
than you do.

1493
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:20,193
I... I do try too hard
because deep down

1494
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:21,796
I'm afraid that I am
what everyone thinks I am.

1495
01:24:22,129 --> 01:24:23,565
And I suppress my discomfort
because I'm worried

1496
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:25,332
it makes me look weak,
and I wanna be strong,

1497
01:24:25,465 --> 01:24:26,601
and I think I'm failing
all the time.

1498
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:28,101
And I only take
what you say personally

1499
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:29,469
because you're
the only one in my life

1500
01:24:29,604 --> 01:24:31,138
who ever believed in me,

1501
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:32,674
even when I don't even
believe in myself.

1502
01:24:32,807 --> 01:24:34,642
And I
should have told you that.

1503
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,845
No one else in the world
matters to me

1504
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:39,413
more than you do either.

1505
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,717
I have unresolved
childhood trauma

1506
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,151
that I refuse to discuss

1507
01:24:44,284 --> 01:24:45,452
because being vulnerable
scares me.

1508
01:24:45,587 --> 01:24:47,187
I make dangerous choices

1509
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:49,122
because I have an unhealthy
bunny hero complex.

1510
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:50,758
And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop.

1511
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:53,795
I joined because I always
wanted to be part of a pack.

1512
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:56,396
And the thought of losing you
scares me because...

1513
01:24:57,765 --> 01:24:59,166
because you're my pack.

1514
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,703
I should never have left you,

1515
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:03,638
and I do need
a herd of therapy animals.

1516
01:25:03,771 --> 01:25:06,239
And I should have told you
that you are the only partner

1517
01:25:06,373 --> 01:25:10,110
-I would ever want because...
-...you're my fluffle.

1518
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:11,813
Mmm. Um...

1519
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:13,648
That's a bunch of rabbits.

1520
01:25:15,349 --> 01:25:16,517
Hmm.

1521
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:19,419
Now that is what we call
an overshare.

1522
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:22,255
I'm alive by the way.
I made it.

1523
01:25:22,389 --> 01:25:24,491
Oh! Also that guy
is still alive.

1524
01:25:27,194 --> 01:25:29,463
Hey! Hey! Thief!

1525
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:31,599
He's gonna get to
the lost reptile neighborhood,

1526
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:34,134
find Gary's great-grandma's
patent and destroy it.

1527
01:25:34,267 --> 01:25:36,403
Yeah, I've got no idea what
that means, or who Gary is,

1528
01:25:36,537 --> 01:25:38,205
but let's go!

1529
01:25:38,338 --> 01:25:40,273
-Hopps and Wilde?
-Wilde and Hopps.

1530
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:42,309
And Nibbles and Gary!

1531
01:25:42,442 --> 01:25:43,410
He's Gary.

1532
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:45,613
Whoa, whoa!

1533
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:48,716
Thank you. It's for the snake.
He's cold. No fur on him.

1534
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,417
-Why, you little...
-Bye now.

1535
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,722
-You!
-Dad!

1536
01:25:54,856 --> 01:25:55,723
You don't belong
in this family!

1537
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:57,257
Wait, wait, wait! Dad!

1538
01:25:57,391 --> 01:25:59,226
You will never
belong in this family!

1539
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:01,929
Wait, wait! I wasn't working
with them. I was helping us.

1540
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:06,433
I know where the reptile
neighborhood is buried.

1541
01:26:06,567 --> 01:26:07,902
Where to find the real patent

1542
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:11,271
that proves that snakes
invented the walls.

1543
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:14,676
I'm going to destroy it,
for the family.

1544
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,612
For you, Daddy.

1545
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:19,947
Uh...

1546
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,216
You want to keep your job,
you say nothing.

1547
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:24,819
You!

1548
01:26:25,553 --> 01:26:27,622
Maybe you are a Lynxley.

1549
01:26:27,755 --> 01:26:29,222
Take me to the patent.

1550
01:26:31,926 --> 01:26:34,327
It takes a threesome
to be somethin',

1551
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,431
but a four-way
to bust your doorway.

1552
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:43,538
Get to the patent! Destroy it!

1553
01:26:45,506 --> 01:26:47,575
Go! We got this.

1554
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:51,746
Hey, whiskers,
you're done hurtin' muh city.

1555
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:54,682
Uh-oh. Tides have turned.

1556
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:57,451
Hey, Brian Winddancer!

1557
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:02,289
You want to be a hero, or
just play one on TV? Ow!

1558
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:29,851
Okay, I go left,
and you go right?

1559
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:32,019
Uh, yeah.

1560
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:34,989
Or...

1561
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:51,539
You are a horrible driver.

1562
01:27:51,672 --> 01:27:53,306
Yes, I am.

1563
01:28:01,082 --> 01:28:02,617
Whoa.

1564
01:28:08,556 --> 01:28:09,924
I'm gonna jump!

1565
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:16,798
Zoogetherness. Huh?

1566
01:28:16,931 --> 01:28:18,733
No, never mind.
Forget I said it. Here we go.

1567
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:24,071
Matches, matches,
matches, matches.

1568
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,340
Bunnies, we're burrowers.

1569
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:28,341
Rabbit kick. Hi-yah!

1570
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:34,582
I'll destroy the patent,

1571
01:28:34,715 --> 01:28:36,884
that town
and everything in it.

1572
01:28:37,018 --> 01:28:40,320
And a dirtbag fox
and a dumb bunny

1573
01:28:40,453 --> 01:28:42,824
will never stand in my way.

1574
01:28:42,957 --> 01:28:44,391
She's not a dumb bunny,

1575
01:28:44,525 --> 01:28:46,027
and you're forgetting
one thing.

1576
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,695
What's that?

1577
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:48,663
We're friends with a snake.

1578
01:28:49,697 --> 01:28:51,966
Howdy, partner.

1579
01:28:52,099 --> 01:28:53,634
Heads up!

1580
01:28:55,837 --> 01:28:58,940
-Daddy!
-Daddy's busy.

1581
01:28:59,073 --> 01:29:00,875
Brian! Go!

1582
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:03,678
You say justice is dead...

1583
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:05,980
...I say neigh!

1584
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:10,450
Ha-cha!

1585
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,623
-Here, kitty-kitty.
-No!

1586
01:29:15,756 --> 01:29:17,725
It's called an arrest,
sweetheart.

1587
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:18,893
Boom.

1588
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:29,103
No one
will believe you over us.

1589

We've always
been better than you.

1590
01:29:31,906 --> 01:29:33,975
And we always will be.

Well, it matters to him.

01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:45,720
Shall we?

1594
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:39,840
Hmm.

1595
01:30:55,056 --> 01:30:57,191
One long sock.

1596
01:31:29,724 --> 01:31:31,792
Oh.

1597
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:43,564
I'm gonna burn it all
to the ground!

1598
01:32:43,697 --> 01:32:47,868
I'm a real Lynxley!

1599

That'll do, pig. That'll do.

1604
01:33:08,389 --> 01:33:12,093
by revealing the true inventor
of the city's weather walls

1605
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:13,894
was a snake.

1606
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:15,596
<i>While the now</i>
<i>disgraced Lynxley family</i>

1607
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:17,898
were revealed to have stolen
the original plans

1608
01:33:18,032 --> 01:33:19,667
<i>and covered it up for decades.</i>

1609
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,370
You have not heard the last
of Milton Lyn...

1610
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:25,372
<i>Their Tundratown expansion</i>

1611
01:33:25,706 --> 01:33:28,242
<i>now officially canceled.</i>

1612
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,845
Some are calling you
the dream team.

1613
01:33:30,978 --> 01:33:32,847
How did you do it?

1614
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,985
Uh... Well, there's a lot of
different animals out there.

1615
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:40,788
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>we start to look</i>

1616
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:43,791
<i>at all the little reasons</i>
<i>that we're not the same.</i>

1617
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:46,260
<i>And it makes us worry.</i>

1618
01:33:48,062 --> 01:33:50,998
<i>But maybe if</i>
<i>we just talked to each other,</i>

1619
01:33:51,132 --> 01:33:54,135
<i>if we just tried</i>
<i>to understand one another,</i>

1620
01:33:54,268 --> 01:33:56,337
<i>we would see</i>
<i>that our differences</i>

1621
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:59,740
<i>don't really make</i>
<i>any difference at all.</i>

1622
01:33:59,874 --> 01:34:05,813
<i>Maybe we'd even see that</i>
<i>what makes me me and you you,</i>

1623
01:34:05,946 --> 01:34:09,950
can make us even stronger.

1624
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:13,687
And with hard work, you're
gonna get to that by year two!

1625
01:34:15,456 --> 01:34:16,690
Zebros.

1626
01:34:17,725 --> 01:34:19,260
Actually, my name is Gene.

1627
01:34:19,393 --> 01:34:21,061
My name...

1628
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:23,430
is also Gene.

1629
01:34:23,764 --> 01:34:24,798
-Zebros!
-Zebros!

1630
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:33,374
He did it!

1631
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,178
Kids, get off the snake.

1632
01:34:37,311 --> 01:34:39,880
Aw!

1633
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,017
Hi. How is everybody doing?

1634
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:44,919
-Oh!
-One sec!

1635
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:58,465
This is my family.

1636
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,768
Permission to hug?

1637
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:06,440
Thank you.

1638
01:35:10,945 --> 01:35:13,747
Hey, uh, I got you something.

1639
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:24,258
Love you, partner.

1640
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:27,828
But I am still me, so I'm
only saying it once a decade.

1641
01:35:27,962 --> 01:35:29,830
<i>Love you, partner.</i>

1642
01:35:29,964 --> 01:35:31,298
Oh, I'm gonna need that back.

1643
01:35:31,432 --> 01:35:33,934
I'll give it back to you
after our next case.

1644
01:35:34,068 --> 01:35:35,803
There's gonna be
another case, huh?

1645
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,005
Of course. Because,
when you broke out of jail,

1646
01:35:38,138 --> 01:35:40,741
you also released 200
highly dangerous prisoners.

1647
01:35:40,874 --> 01:35:42,109
Worth it.

1648
01:35:42,243 --> 01:35:44,044
Any idea
where you want to start?

1649
01:35:50,184 --> 01:35:52,086
Oh. Mmm. Mmm.

1650
01:35:52,219 --> 01:35:55,122
One-way ticket
to Outback Island, please.

1651
01:35:55,256 --> 01:35:56,223
First class.

1652
01:35:56,357 --> 01:35:58,092
Very nice.

1653
01:35:58,225 --> 01:36:00,794
Oh, and remember, if you're
happy with our service,

1654
01:36:00,928 --> 01:36:04,198
please be sure to leave us
four thumbs up.

1655
01:36:04,331 --> 01:36:06,133
Oh, I will.

1656
01:36:12,006 --> 01:36:13,007
Hopps and Wilde?

1657
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,943
Wilde and Cabbagepatch.
