WEBVTT

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.627
Bleh...

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.664
Blood. Blood. Blood.
And death.

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:31.331
All right. You know
what? You're milking it.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.166
Besides, I think we got it.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.670
We got it up there.
Thank you, Yakkity-yak.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.271
You laid it all out
beautifully.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.107
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you too.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.309
It's my word against yours.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.311
Actually...

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.179
And I'll dart
every predator in Zootopia

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.582
to keep it that way.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:49.551
-It's your word against yours.
-Huh?

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:51.719
It's called a hustle,
sweetheart.

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:52.754
Boom.

00:00:55.757 --> 00:00:59.627
Unlikely duo Judy Hopps,
the city's first bunny cop,

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.429
and Nicholas Wilde,
a small-time street fox,

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:05.767
uncovered a conspiracy
by Mayor Bellwether today

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.168
using a toy carrot
recorder pen.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:09.737
I can frame you too.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.177
Wilde later
joined the ZPD himself,

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.247
where the pair are now the
very first bunny-fox team

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.482
in the history of Zootopia.

00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:26.453
New mayor and former actor
Brian Winddancer

00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.288
hailed the two

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.424
during celebrations
for the 100th anniversary

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.360
of the invention
of Zootopia's weather walls

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.697
that allowed all environments
and all animals

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.165
to coexist in one city.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.502
This is our Zootennial!

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.705
And if a lowly country bunny

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:46.206
and a shifty,
likely criminal fox

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.276
can ignore
their vast, vast differences

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.580
and solve bias
and stereotype forever,

00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:57.417
then maybe we can all
embrace our differences

00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:00.187
and be better zoogether.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.191
We're gonna crack a new case,
make the world a better place,

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.360
and be the greatest partners
of all time.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.662
Hmm.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.329
I mean,
we're not that different.

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:22.510
At the ZPD,

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:27.214
partnership
is the cornerstone of success.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.383
You want to put bad guys away?

00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:32.352
Be on the same page.
Every day.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.623
Now today's bad guy is
this customs inspector

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:38.726
who's been smuggling
illegal overseas cargo

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.327
through the city's shipyard.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.731
Captains Hoggbottom
and Truffler will lead.

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:46.233
Higgins, Bloats, flank left.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.902
Chèvre, Bûcheron, right.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.270
And down the middle,
the Zebros.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.205
Zebros!

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.608
Hopps and Wilde, I know you're
eager to prove yourselves,

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.410
but as rookies,
you will observe only

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:59.379
and watch the veteran teams
show you how it's...

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.650
Chief, hi.

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:03.885
If you're looking
for Nick and Judy,

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.687
they said they got it.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.489
And they are already on site,
with their baby!

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.767
Are you sure this'll work?

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.569
You're the one that said
we needed a bust.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.705
Just follow my lead, okay?
Act casual.

00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:24.906
-Hey!
-Here we go.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.273
Hello?

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.675
This whole area's restricted.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:28.943
You can't be here.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:31.679
Whoa. Fox and bunny. Okay.

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:33.881
Yes, but proud parents first.

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:36.216
-Mister...
-Inspector.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.518
Inspector Snootley.

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:40.487
Inspector? What do you do?

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.322
Ensure that nothing illegal
gets smuggled here

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:43.925
in one of these
cargo containers?

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.794
That's a weird way
to ask that.

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:48.930
Anyway, you gotta leave.
You can't be here.

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:51.599
-Oh.
-Wait. Wait.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.467
He's right, gosh darn it.

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.703
You are right, sir.

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.873
I guess we should've thought
this through. Right, babe?

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.309
Before we decided
to come down here

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.713
to this beautiful
industrial shipyard

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:11.485
to celebrate the big day
of our birthday boy.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.321
It's his birthday?

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.591
Yeah. First one since...

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:18.726
...since the accident.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.829
And, you know, the one thing

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:23.598
this little stinker
wished for...

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.033
...aside from one day
getting his tail reattached,

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.336
was to see a choo-choo.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.774
And to maybe get a toot-toot
conductor to sign his cast.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:36.911
But I'm betting
a customs inspector

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.278
would be even better.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:39.881
Really?

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:41.749
All right.
For the kid. For the kid.

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:43.785
Oh, you're a saint.

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:46.286
We thank you so much.
Here you go. Either leg.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.388
Or both. I don't care.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:49.690
Maybe put a doodle on it.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:50.792
Doesn't need to be perfect.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.527
He's also legally blind.

00:04:58.498 --> 00:04:59.734
I put a little train there
because

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.301
I know you like trains.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.070
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.639
-Just jiggle it.
-Yes. I know.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:06.040
-Hurry!
-I got this.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:06.908
Jiggle it.
Jiggle it. Jiggle it!

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:09.544
Hopps and Wilde,

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:10.912
you are not authorized.

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:13.047
Stand down
and wait for backup.

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:18.485
Toot, toot.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:19.921
-It's the fuzz!
-Stop!

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:23.090
-Stop in the name of the law!
-Everybody run!

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.562
Well, can't win 'em all.

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:30.031
Get outta the road,
you dumb bunny.

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.099
Hmm. Agree to disagree.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.771
My hog rod!
This is a snoutrage!

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.576
Hopps and Wilde
in pursuit of suspect

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.811
in a stolen catering van
heading east...

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.079
Stop it.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.014
...heading east
through Sheepshire.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:05:59.660
Whoa!

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:01.963
Beautiful.

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.698
I'll have what he's having.

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.700
Darling,
I believe your driving

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.735
is giving me some white hairs.

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.037
Also, am I always gonna be
in the passenger's seat?

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.906
'Cause if we're
establishing sides...

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.041
Back off, rookies!

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:15.977
Let the real teams handle it.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.780
-Ma'am, we are a real team.
-Shortcut. Take the tunnel.

00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:32.627
Stand down, noobs. We got him.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.629
-Rolling spikes!
-Rolling spikes!

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.440
I hate that dumb bunny.

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.018
Oh...

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.498
-I'm gonna jump.
-What?

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.134
No, no. What are you...

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.002
Carrots, hey... I would like
to call a partner meeting.

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:16.203
No, Carrots!

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.471
Judy!

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:29.449
Please join me
in a moment of silence

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:33.587
for our beloved weather wall
inventor Ebenezer Lynxley.

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:39.794
Zebros!

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:43.597
Huh?

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:56.143
Reptile?

00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:02.049
Chief, those two
are out of control!

00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:05.086
Zootopia ain't just
a mammal city.

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:09.056
It has a secret,
tiny reptile population,

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.726
though most live abroad.

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:15.563
Of course, Zootopia does not
allow snakes.

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:17.198
There ain't been one of those
around here

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.166
for at least a hundred years.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.169
"Scales and tales
of the weird."

00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:25.272
Yeah, not sure
Nibbles Maplestick

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.875
is our most reliable source.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.012
Bunny,
orange dog, in here now.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.215
Sir, today may not
have been ideal,

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:35.149
but the anteater was captured.

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:36.617
By the Zebros!

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.185
-Zebros!
-Shut it!

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.021
Zebros.

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:41.088
It was us.

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:42.790
But more importantly,

00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:45.292
I believe we may have made
a significant discovery.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.662
The stolen van contained a
smuggled crate from overseas,

00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:49.964
pamphlets for the Zootennial,

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:51.899
and some type of reptile skin.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:53.634
I've already sent samples
for testing.

00:08:53.768 --> 00:08:56.170
-And if you...
-What needs testing is you!

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.706
You two tore up half the city.

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.208
Because of you,
we had to call in Jumbo Unit

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.277
to remove a dik-dik
from a tuba!

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:04.879
You're almost out.
You're gonna be...

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:06.981
No! Please, no!

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.749
Who's catching him?

00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:10.317
Sorry, could you show me
that clip again?

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:12.253
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:16.290
Did you or did you not disobey
a direct order to stand down?

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:17.958
Sir, we were in pursuit.

00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:19.827
And article 6,
paragraph B states,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.128
"If the lead officers
think that..."

00:09:21.262 --> 00:09:22.930
You are not lead officers!

00:09:23.064 --> 00:09:24.231
You're one-hit wonders

00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:25.833
who should go back
to meter maiding

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.768
and slinging pawpsicles!

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.337
If I may, I think
someone's just jealous

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.139
that we got to drive
the squeal mobile.

00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:34.842
Or maybe you thought
it was your momma.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.912
Enough! Everybody out.

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:44.685
Officer Hopps,

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:48.622
despite my best efforts
to avoid it, I like you.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:53.994
But this need to overdo it

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:57.598
made both of you
a headline today.

00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:01.102
And it reflects badly on me,
on the department,

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:02.837
and frankly

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.041
on any bunny hoping
to follow in your footsteps.

00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:11.846
Not every case
is going to save the world.

00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:14.615
Knock-knock.

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:16.250
Hi.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:17.718
You know, this kinda...
this sounds a lot

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.720
like a... just a
"you guys" conversation.

00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:21.689
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go ahead and...

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:24.725
Is there a reason why you
don't take anything seriously?

00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:26.060
Jokes are
a classic defense mechanism

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.394
for someone with
a traumatic childhood.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.697
Would you like
a traumatic adulthood?

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.632
I would not.

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:33.067
I allowed you to work together

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.036
because you did this city
a great service.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.106
But today,
you messed it all up.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.175
And now, some are questioning

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.110
whether you should've been
partners in the first place.

00:10:43.244 --> 00:10:44.678
-Sir...
-So,

00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:46.947
instead of chasing
imaginary reptiles,

00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:48.649
I am pulling you
from the field...

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:49.950
What?

00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:51.318
...and giving you
a new assignment

00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:54.922
reserved for special teams
like yourselves.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:11:00.394
Fail at this, and I will have
no choice but to split you up.

00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:03.197
There will be no more
Hopps and Wilde.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.334
But if you're as good
as you think you are,

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:10.271
this is your moment to shine.

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:15.943
Welcome to Partners in Crisis,

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:19.280
a workshop for duos heading
for disaster.

00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:22.216
I'm your therapy animal,
Dr. Fuzzby.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.118
And you are here

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:27.121
because mismatched pairings
often need a little more work

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.123
to make them work.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.692
Greg, we talked about that.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:32.927
What are we making Marlon?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.296
Uncomfortable. Yes.

00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:38.399
And, Francine,
Clark may be a mouse,

00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.868
but he is your partner first.

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:45.005
And we have two
new "apart-ners."

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.174
Can you tell us
about your journey

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.343
to dysfunction junction?

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:53.714
Well, we've been official
partners for one week.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.416
Happy anniversary.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.118
And we're not dysfunctional
at all, actually.

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:00.321
Functioning fine.
Better than fine.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.323
And we did sort of
save the city,

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:06.160
so us being here kinda seems
like a huge misunderstanding.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.796
Notice how she answered first,

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.264
did not allow her partner
to speak,

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.066
seems to be
in a state of denial

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:13.968
and taps her foot when
she's suppressing discomfort.

00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:17.071
And observe the source
of her discomfort

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.073
represented by
the disconnected affectation

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:21.141
of her emotionally
insecure partner.

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:23.177
Oh!

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.079
But with hard work, they'll be
on the same page by year two.

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:26.947
-Huh?
-Oh.

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:29.216
But for now, let's begin
by greeting our teammate.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.851
Who would like to go first?

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.119
Thank you, Joel.

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:37.358
Okay, unfortunately,
Karen has chosen

00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:40.828
to see Joel's smile
as a sign of aggression.

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:43.497
Hackles down, Karen.
Karen, hackles down.

00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:45.866
Joel, the safe word
is "coconut."

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.034
Coconut!

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.305
Okay, we have to set another
meeting with the Chief.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.140
Promise we'll be better.

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.143
Zebros!

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:58.879
You talk back less.
Maybe not at all.

00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:02.349
Yeah. Or we go with my
playbook, and we just lay low.

00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.351
We cannot prove ourselves

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:05.819
if we are stuck in that room.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:07.154
And if we complain
to Chief Beef,

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:08.523
he'll just make us
stay longer.

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:10.357
Play it smart.
Stay off the radar.

00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:12.293
And don't let it get to you.
Okay?

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:14.495
'Cause we are the dream team.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:18.499
Sorry, Paul.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.572
Roll out the red carpet.
Here's the super cops.

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.974
Hey, what does the fox say?

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.042
You suck!

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:29.276
Easy, partner.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.844
Let me ask you something.

00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.279
Do you think
we're a good team?

00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:33.847
Of course.

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:35.182
I just...

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:36.884
I just wish I knew
what we had to do

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.787
to prove it to everyone else.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:41.889
Or maybe we don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

00:13:43.324 --> 00:13:45.192
Hmm.

00:13:45.326 --> 00:13:47.529
-We do. Forever.
-Oof!

00:13:47.662 --> 00:13:49.330
And the sooner
everyone sees

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.131
a fox and a bunny can be
great partners, the better.

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:53.033
Enjoy it. I got two.

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:54.868
I'd rather chew off
my own arm.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.870
Happy anniversary!

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.046
Coconut!

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.214
Coconut!

00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:34.375
So, saw you on TV.
You okay?

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.343
Everything's fine, Mom.

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:38.613
Uh-oh. Everyone knows
"fine" is a cry for help.

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:40.214
You know who else
cried for help?

00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:42.216
That dik-dik
stuck in that tuba.

00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:44.318
Oh, him and the dik-dik. What
does your fox partner say?

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:48.922
Well, Nick's
not really a talker.

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:51.458
Well, you two
are very different.

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:53.927
Small-town hero
raised on a farm.

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:55.630
Big-city crook
raised on the streets.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:57.498
I pray every day

00:14:57.632 --> 00:14:58.566
that you'll come back home
and make babies.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.367
Mom!

00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:02.035
Just remember the first rule
of partnerships.

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:03.237
You can be right
or you can be happy.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.272
That's true.

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.373
There's nothing wrong
with dying a little inside

00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:07.609
so you can meet in the middle.

00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:09.143
Honey, you're pushing me out.

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:10.911
I wanna make sure
I can be seen.

00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:12.346
Well, if she
could see both of us.

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:13.981
-Gotta go. Work to do.
-Bye, bun-bun.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.550
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:15:15.683 --> 00:15:17.151
-You two just need a new case.
-Got it. Love you.

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:17.619
Maybe try to find
that dik-dik.

00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:18.285
Bye.

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:32.399
Squeal of Fortune!

00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:35.335
Tomorrow's weather is,
again, everything.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.004
...to announce that

00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:38.673
the long-awaited
Tundratown expansion

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:40.340
will be starting soon.

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:41.975
Residents continue
to raise concerns

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.678
about the future
of their neighborhood.

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:47.549
But tonight
we put our differences aside

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.483
and celebrate
at the Zootennial gala,

00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:52.119
where the Lynxley Journal
will be on display

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.388
for the first time
in a century,

00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:57.090
following an infamous
reptile attack.

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.226
The Lynxley Journal,

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:01.061
containing the patented
weather wall plans,

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:03.598
was originally written by
Ebenezer Lynxley,

00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:04.699
bringing the whole...

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:21.215
Same catering company.

00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:24.586
Mmm.

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:35.563
The Lynxley journal.

00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:45.372
Truth bomb!

00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:47.140
The 100th anniversary
of the weather walls

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.544
is also the 100th anniversary

00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:52.547
of Zootopia's
only snake attack.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.649
The victim? A tortoise.

00:16:54.782 --> 00:16:57.619
The Lynxley family maid

00:16:57.752 --> 00:17:00.487
who was fanged while stopping
a venomous snake

00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:03.090
from stealing
the Lynxley Journal.

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:05.660
No one has seen a snake
in Zootopia since.

00:17:05.793 --> 00:17:09.329
But I'm convinced
one will return.

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.131
My only question is,

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:16.370
is he gonna be wearing
half-a-pants or one long sock?

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:23.811
You say, "Justice is dead."

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.280
I say, "Neigh!"

00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:27.582
Ha-cha!

00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:33.387
Well, well,
you miss me already, huh?

00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:34.789
The stolen van
with the snake skin

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.390
is from the same
catering company

00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:37.759
-that's working the gala.
-Mm-hmm.

00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:39.459
This is you studying
your partner book?

00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:41.228
Listen to me. Venomous snakes

00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:43.196
tried to steal
the Lynxleys's journal before.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.098
What if they're back in town
to steal it again?

00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:46.534
No snake has set foot...

00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:49.303
...in Zootopia in forever,
okay?

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:51.071
Even if they had feet.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:52.339
Look, we're already
in the hot seat, Carrots,

00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:53.808
and pizza's here. Gotta go--

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:55.108
If there's a fanging
at the gala

00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:56.343
and we do nothing to stop it,

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:58.211
then we are not
doing our jobs...

00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:01.114
Yikes. No wonder
you never invite me over.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:02.584
Foxes are solitary.

00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:04.752
And, look, we go
and you're wrong,

00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:06.119
Chief Beef will split us up.

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:07.454
And if we don't get a win soon

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:08.690
and prove
we're great partners,

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.457
the chief will
split us up anyway.

00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:12.092
Check the perimeter.
Snoop a little.

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.761
We find nothing, we bail.

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.128
But if I'm right,

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:16.531
no one will question

00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:18.432
whether you and I
belong together again.

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:20.367
We need this.

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.236
Fine.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.272
But we'll still have
to get through security,

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:26.708
and in fancy town,
a fox and a bunny

00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:29.209
won't exactly blend in. Oof!

00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:31.278
That's why
we'll be undercover!

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.552

Ha-cha!

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.532
...star of the revenge
trilogy, The Neigh-sayer.

00:19:57.665 --> 00:19:59.199
No pictures, please.

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:01.234
Come on. It's me.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.604
And that, and that one,
and then this one.

00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:05.707
Mr. Lynxley,
when will you begin

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.240
-the Tundratown expansion?
-Come on, Dad.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.610

at the party.

No snow.

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:33.501
Hmm.

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:35.435
This one's warmer.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.506
A reptile in Tundratown might
need that to survive the cold.

00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:42.677
Oh, my God. A viper!

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.312
A "vindow viper." Ja.

00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:51.519
Back door ajar.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:52.987
Anyone could have
left it like that.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.589
And you said,
"Snoop a little,"

00:20:54.722 --> 00:20:56.323
not break and enter-- Oh, God!

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.893
Oh, we were always
going inside. Got it.

00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:00.595
Same page means your page.

00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:02.295
It's called a hustle,
sweetheart.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:03.898
You change out here.
I get the van.

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:20.782
Huh.

00:21:20.915 --> 00:21:22.617
It's the Zootennial Gala.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.951
A bunny comes prepared.

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.388
You know, I used to dream of

00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:30.024
infiltrating a place
like this.

00:21:36.898 --> 00:21:40.535
You know, this is not
your worst idea.

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:42.870
Wow, that was almost
a compliment.

00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:44.872
Your worst idea is
what you did with your ears.

00:21:46.808 --> 00:21:47.809
All right.

00:22:00.087 --> 00:22:02.489
Welcome to
the Zootennial Gala...

00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:06.894
...featuring the original
Lynxley Journal.

00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:10.932
Why would a snake wanna steal
some old book anyway?

00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:12.499
I don't know.

00:22:12.633 --> 00:22:13.668
Yeehaw!

00:22:13.801 --> 00:22:15.536
But no one is gonna steal it,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.470
because we are here
to protect it.

00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:24.045
The journal is in
the reserved section. Okay.

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:26.681
Come on.

00:22:26.814 --> 00:22:28.448
Slow down.

00:22:28.583 --> 00:22:31.519
You want to fit in?
Commando is not gonna cut it.

00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:33.521
It's not just the clothes,
m'kay?

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:35.022
It is the vibe.

00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:37.825
Good to see ya.
Hey, real nice humps.

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:40.928
Oh, is that real mink?
This is real fox.

00:22:41.062 --> 00:22:42.864
Get invited to a lot of these?

00:22:42.997 --> 00:22:45.066
Mmm. Invited? No.

00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:47.702
But there's other reasons
to hob knob.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.806
Madam, excuse me.
Is this yours?

00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:53.406
Why, yes.

00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:56.110
Well, allow me.

00:22:57.945 --> 00:22:59.547
Clever fox.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.481
Ooh, there!

00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:04.518
I don't think
it has enough guards.

00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.721
I'll get a closer look.
Watch my six.

00:23:12.727 --> 00:23:14.427
Uh-oh. Bogo alert.

00:23:14.562 --> 00:23:15.596
Ah.

00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:27.975
Hmm.

00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:30.111
Cover's made of metal.

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:32.813
Gruffalo
Buffalo has joined the mix.

00:23:32.947 --> 00:23:34.048
Three o'clock.

00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:44.892
-Oh! Excuse me. I am so sorry.
-Oh! Oh, no. Sorry.

00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:46.827
Here, lemme just... Oh, nope.

00:23:46.961 --> 00:23:49.864
That belongs to you.
I apologize.

00:23:49.997 --> 00:23:51.599
Oh, gosh. He hates me.

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:52.600
Here.

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:54.467
Ah! You're my hero.

00:23:54.602 --> 00:23:57.738
Well, just like to be prepared
for any possible scenario.

00:23:57.872 --> 00:24:00.473
Which is not a weird thing
to say at a party.

00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:02.944
Well, I just mopped a spill
with that guy's tail,

00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:04.211
so...

00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:05.579
Paw!

00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:09.717
Uh, Pawbert. I am Pawbert. Hi.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.152
Judy. I'm Judy Hopps.

00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:13.087
Argh! What the pork?

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.156
Well, 'tis nice
to meet you, Judy...

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:17.792
Wait. Judy Hopps?
The Judy Hopps?

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:19.627
Are you working this?

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.829
I mean, you're clearly
working it.

00:24:21.963 --> 00:24:23.631
But are you actually
working this?

00:24:23.764 --> 00:24:25.866
Uh, no.
I'm actually...

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.101
Well, it's just a hunch.

00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.469
...protecting that.

00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:31.639
Good. I don't think
it has enough guards.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.542
Uh, that was my joke.

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:35.810
Yeah, and there's
nothing here.

00:24:35.943 --> 00:24:37.545
Let's call it a night.

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:38.713
Hopps?

00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:45.920
Well, we should...

00:24:46.053 --> 00:24:47.021
It was nice to meet you.

00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:48.656
Yes, and you.

00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:49.890
Uh, bon appétit.

00:24:50.024 --> 00:24:51.993
If, at any point tonight,

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:53.493
you choose to eat,
bon appétit then.

00:24:55.129 --> 00:24:56.564
You're supposed to be
off stage, Pawbert.

00:24:56.697 --> 00:24:58.733
Yeah, get off stage, Pawbert.

00:24:58.866 --> 00:24:59.900
Wait, are you...

00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:02.603
Yeah, I am a Lynxley.

00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:04.071
Or, you know,
I'm trying to be.

00:25:04.205 --> 00:25:05.206
Now, Pawbert.

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:06.640
Come on, Papi.

00:25:06.774 --> 00:25:07.708
I got you, Pa.
Don't you worry.

00:25:07.842 --> 00:25:09.543
No, I have him. I have him.

00:25:09.677 --> 00:25:11.545
All right,
let's get this thing started.

00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:15.783
Huh.

00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:17.985
Welcome to
the Zootennial Gala.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:20.721
Hey, Hopps.
I think I might actually...

00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:22.023
I think I've got something.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.191
Ah. Look at you all.

00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:26.827
Good to see ya.

00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:28.596
It is with great pleasure

00:25:28.729 --> 00:25:30.931
that I introduce the
third-generation visionary...

00:25:31.065 --> 00:25:33.267
Carrots, can you hear me?
I have a trail.

00:25:33.601 --> 00:25:34.568
...who has continued

00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:35.870
the legacy of our great city,

00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:37.805
Milton Lynxley.

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:39.206
Thank you.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.674
-Thank you very much.
-Carrots. Carrots.

00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:44.178
What are you doing here?

00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:45.646
Chief, she was right.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.614
-You're done.
-Wait. No, no.

00:25:46.747 --> 00:25:47.581
You're both done.

00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:49.216
My grandpa had a dream

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.118
to build a city
for all animals.

00:25:51.252 --> 00:25:52.920
Nick?

00:25:53.054 --> 00:25:57.058
To truly be better together.

00:26:07.868 --> 00:26:09.170
There's a snake!

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.337
Snake, snake, snake!

00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:12.840
Go, bro, go.

00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:14.809
I will remember you, zebra.

00:26:23.851 --> 00:26:24.852
Ah!

00:26:30.091 --> 00:26:31.125
Whoa!

00:26:38.199 --> 00:26:39.366
Judy. Judy!

00:26:44.772 --> 00:26:45.973
I knew it!

00:27:04.258 --> 00:27:05.326
Stop!

00:27:06.994 --> 00:27:09.130
Please.
You don't have to hurt him.

00:27:10.464 --> 00:27:11.699
Hurt him?

00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:16.337
Snakes never hurt anyone.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.405
We aren't the bad guys.

00:27:19.173 --> 00:27:20.407
They are.

00:27:21.543 --> 00:27:26.213
And this journal holds
the secret that will prove it.

00:27:27.014 --> 00:27:31.051
I have to prove it. Please.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.257
This is our only chance
to set things right.

00:27:36.891 --> 00:27:38.659
And when I do,

00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:43.364
my family will finally
be able to come home.

00:27:43.497 --> 00:27:44.698
Woo!

00:27:44.832 --> 00:27:46.767
-Oh, no!
-I am here.

00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:48.669
Hopps and Wilde...
...dream team.

00:27:49.203 --> 00:27:51.138
We got him. Or her.

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:53.240
Reptiles, it's, like,
who knows?

00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:56.410
The cops are right behind us.

00:27:57.845 --> 00:27:59.146
Kill the snake.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.748
We'll burn the journal.

00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:04.185
If he wants it,
it's dangerous.

00:28:04.318 --> 00:28:08.789
And then you two will file
a report that he attacked us,

00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:12.459
and you will keep
your mouths shut.

00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:16.030
Step aside.

00:28:20.134 --> 00:28:21.702
Put out the fire!

00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:24.738
-Carrots, come on.
-Help me save him.

00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:26.173
-Carrots, we need--
-Nick.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.475
Cold! Cold!

00:28:35.883 --> 00:28:36.850
Chief.

00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:38.485
He'll be okay.

00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:40.854
Antivenom. He can be saved
with antivenom.

00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:43.290
Hopps, what did you do?

00:28:43.424 --> 00:28:45.092
-No, Hogg-- Hoggbottom.
-They're helping the snake.

00:28:45.226 --> 00:28:46.493
They're trying to kill
the chief!

00:28:46.827 --> 00:28:48.128
-Hoggbottom, no. Please.
-Backup! I need backup!

00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:49.763
-My page. Let's go.
-Wait, wait, wait.

00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:52.066
I need the journal
and probably a sweater.

00:28:53.334 --> 00:28:54.902
W-whoa.

00:28:55.035 --> 00:28:57.037
Cold.

00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:01.976
-On the ground.
-Wait.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.179
-Oi!
-Next time, we stay home?

00:29:05.312 --> 00:29:06.514
Don't you move.

00:29:10.484 --> 00:29:11.852
No. Stop them!

00:29:11.986 --> 00:29:12.920
-Oi!
-Come on.

00:29:13.053 --> 00:29:14.288
-Stop!
-Come on!

00:29:14.421 --> 00:29:15.889
Stop!

00:29:20.127 --> 00:29:22.296
I really am just a dumb bunny.

00:29:22.429 --> 00:29:24.465
Accident.
Your words, not mine.

00:29:34.108 --> 00:29:36.043
Put 'em in the trunk.

00:29:47.555 --> 00:29:49.957
"Ter-roar" in Tundratown.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.859
A fanging at the fiesta.

00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:53.994
A howl-a at the gala

00:29:54.128 --> 00:29:56.230
as a venomous snake
attacks the founding family.

00:29:56.363 --> 00:29:58.232
More shocking,
the snake was aided

00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:01.835
by embattled ZPD officers
Nicholas Wilde and Judy Hopps.

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:04.271
All three now suspects
in the tragic fanging

00:30:04.405 --> 00:30:06.106
of Zootopia's chief of police

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.876
and considered
extremely dangerous.

00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:11.145
Chief Bogo...

00:30:12.212 --> 00:30:13.013
is dead.

00:30:15.115 --> 00:30:17.084
Those are words I'm glad
I don't have to say.

00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:19.486
I might have to soon.

00:30:19.621 --> 00:30:21.255
The doctors
are a little weirded out, but

00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:26.060
what has happened tonight
was more than horseplay.

00:30:29.063 --> 00:30:30.431
Hmm.

00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:32.333
Uh, we, uh...

00:30:32.466 --> 00:30:34.868
We're gonna take
that snake down.

00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:38.005
And the fox and that rabbit!

00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:42.443
Do you know how many mayors
they've already destroyed?

00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:49.016
One, two... I got up to two.

00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:51.318
Would you like to be "three"?

00:30:52.219 --> 00:30:54.589
I want them gone.

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:58.892
But aren't there... laws?

00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:04.064
I will say this once, Brian.

00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:09.203
You will retrieve the journal
and bury them.

00:31:10.237 --> 00:31:11.606
Or maybe

00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:13.907
I chose the wrong mayor.

00:31:15.643 --> 00:31:18.546
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:49.243
Hmm.

00:32:08.563 --> 00:32:10.164
Hey.

00:32:10.297 --> 00:32:12.199
The phone is the first thing
they'll track.

00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:19.139
Sorry. I have never been on
the run from the law before.

00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:21.208
Yeah. Boy.

00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:24.178
It's almost like we shouldn't
have gone to that gala, huh?

00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:26.046
Okie doke.
We already did it your way.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.315
With Mr. Big, we do it mine.

00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:31.051
This is where having
a partner from the underworld

00:32:31.185 --> 00:32:32.486
is really gonna pay off.

00:32:33.487 --> 00:32:35.723
Raymond! And is that Kev...

00:32:59.446 --> 00:33:02.115
Welcome to my warehouse.

00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:03.551
Oh, my God, I love your dress.

00:33:03.685 --> 00:33:05.620
Oh! Thank you.

00:33:05.753 --> 00:33:07.187
Fru Fru and I

00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:10.457
are now equal partners
in the family business.

00:33:10.592 --> 00:33:14.596
She brings wonderful ideas
for crime and for fashion

00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:19.199
while I get more time to focus
on what matters most:

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:22.102
being grandpapa
to my little Judith.

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:23.705
Kiss my ring.

00:33:25.405 --> 00:33:26.440
Kiss the stinkin' ring
right now!

00:33:26.574 --> 00:33:27.174
You kiss it right now!
Kiss it!

00:33:27.609 --> 00:33:29.009
Mwah.

00:33:29.142 --> 00:33:30.578
Nonno, you said we were gonna

00:33:30.712 --> 00:33:33.180
make cement shoes
for Mr. Weaselton.

00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:35.148
Oh, that's my girl.

00:33:35.282 --> 00:33:37.017
They grow up so fast.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.186
-You shut your mouth, fox!
-You run your mouth too much!

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.089
Anyways, you're in trouble.

00:33:42.222 --> 00:33:45.660
And we like one of yas,
so we're here to help.

00:33:45.793 --> 00:33:48.295
New clothes. New identities.

00:33:48.428 --> 00:33:50.297
Truck out of town
leaves in an hour.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.567
And your meter maid cart
is taken care of.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.805
I think you misunderstand.

00:33:58.138 --> 00:34:00.173
We've been framed
by the lynxes.

00:34:00.307 --> 00:34:01.375
And an innocent snake needs...

00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:03.645
Judy, the lynxes
are killers...

00:34:03.778 --> 00:34:06.814
...and they have no honor.

00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:09.182
And this Tundratown expansion

00:34:09.316 --> 00:34:11.485
only makes them
more dangerous.

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:15.757
Territorial animals will do
anything for more land.

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.592
So, if whatever
you're tangled up in

00:34:17.725 --> 00:34:21.161
threatens their plans,
you're dead.

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:24.498
You don't fight the cats.
You leave.

00:34:24.632 --> 00:34:27.635
Sir, I know you're trying
to look out for us.

00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:30.437
But we took an oath
to protect this city.

00:34:30.572 --> 00:34:32.272
And justice doesn't run.

00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:33.741
On behalf of myself,

00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:38.111
"Rick Wilde,"
and "Miss Trudy Cabbagepatch,"

00:34:38.245 --> 00:34:40.314
we thank you for your truck
to salvation and-- Ow!

00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.448
We cannot accept your offer.

00:34:41.583 --> 00:34:43.250
We are helping that snake.

00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:44.819
Boy, you're really
tossing that "we" around.

00:34:45.152 --> 00:34:46.320
Snakes may have been framed

00:34:46.453 --> 00:34:47.589
for the fanging
of that tortoise.

00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:49.389
Do you have any idea why?

00:34:49.524 --> 00:34:51.759
Or how this book
could prove it?

00:34:51.893 --> 00:34:53.795
I wish I did.

00:34:53.928 --> 00:34:56.229
But if it has to do
with snakes,

00:34:56.363 --> 00:34:59.399
your best bet
is talking to a reptile.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.603
Do you know any?

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:03.771
Almost no one does.

00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:08.108
They keep to themselves,
hide out in Marsh Market.

00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:09.844
But you can still find 'em.

00:35:10.177 --> 00:35:12.446
You just need
a reptile expert.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.882
Someone local
who knows where to go.

00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:16.884
Lucky for you, I met someone.

00:35:17.217 --> 00:35:19.386
She runs a podcast!

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.089
No, no.
Trudy Cabbagepatch,

00:35:21.254 --> 00:35:23.323
Rick Wilde says no.

00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.226
Oh, yeah!

00:35:27.394 --> 00:35:29.363
If Hopps and Wilde
are on the lam,

00:35:29.496 --> 00:35:32.265
subtle sleuthin' 'tis my jam.

00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:34.234
Woo! Mind the splinters.

00:35:34.368 --> 00:35:35.737
Oh, you called
the right beaver.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.840
If you wanna talk to
a reptile, I am your gal.

00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:40.675
Also, if you need to talk
to a jackalope,

00:35:40.808 --> 00:35:43.578
which are real, Mom!

00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:46.179
Excuse us. Team meeting.

00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:47.649
Vetoing the beave.

00:35:47.782 --> 00:35:50.283
New vote: All in favor
of "Truck to Being Alive

00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:52.920
and Laying Low Till This
Blows Over-ville"? I mean...

00:35:53.253 --> 00:35:54.922
Hopps and Wilde
do not bail on a case.

00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:56.691
But she's crazy.

00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:58.793
Probably lead poisoning
from eating too many pencils.

00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:02.797
Do you know a reptile who can

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.331
tell us the hidden secret
in here,

00:36:04.464 --> 00:36:05.767
or why the lynxes
framed the snakes?

00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:09.704
Twenty-four hours.
Sunrise tomorrow.

00:36:09.837 --> 00:36:11.739
If we strike out,
then we go into hiding,

00:36:11.873 --> 00:36:13.306
and "Judy Cabbagepatch" it is.

00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.512
It's "Trudy" Cabbagepatch,

00:36:17.645 --> 00:36:18.913
and the safe word
is "coconut."

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:21.415
In the darkness
of a dank underpass,

00:36:21.549 --> 00:36:22.950
they stepped into the vehicle,

00:36:23.283 --> 00:36:26.453
not realizing their lives
were about to change.

00:36:26.587 --> 00:36:28.656
Because we're gonna
meet a reptile?

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.792
Because you're about to be
best buds

00:36:30.925 --> 00:36:33.761
with Nibbles Maplestick!

00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:37.497
Takes two to tango, but
a threesome to be somethin'.

00:36:37.632 --> 00:36:41.201
Let's find you a reptile
and romp the swamp.

00:36:49.544 --> 00:36:51.278
Breathe it in!

00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:52.780
Oh!

00:36:56.483 --> 00:36:57.919
Now, if any reptile
would know

00:36:58.052 --> 00:37:00.320
the secret of that book
and why the snake wants it...

00:37:00.454 --> 00:37:02.289
-Hey, Johnny!
-Oh, no!

00:37:02.422 --> 00:37:04.692
...it's my old lizard friend,
Jesús.

00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:07.929
Why would a lizard
hide here?

00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:11.599
Well, when Zootopia
was founded,

00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:13.601
the whole neighborhood
got cut off

00:37:13.735 --> 00:37:14.902
from the rest of the town.

00:37:15.036 --> 00:37:16.470
Kinda on our own here.

00:37:18.338 --> 00:37:19.607
Yeah, that's probably why
reptiles like it.

00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:21.408
They can just do their thing.

00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:23.010
Plus, it's the only place
in town

00:37:23.343 --> 00:37:25.813
you can get away with
wearing a shirt and no pants.

00:37:25.947 --> 00:37:27.882
Loving tour time
with Woodchuckles.

00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:29.483
Great call.

00:37:29.617 --> 00:37:30.985
-We need her.
-Oh, yeah.

00:37:31.318 --> 00:37:32.252
Like a hole in the head.

00:37:33.386 --> 00:37:35.489
Bad timing. Hmm.

00:37:35.623 --> 00:37:37.725
Okay, to get to
Jesús's hideout,

00:37:37.859 --> 00:37:39.392
we gotta take a ferry.

00:37:39.527 --> 00:37:41.294
Just let me handle the locals.

00:37:41.428 --> 00:37:43.598
Water folk tend to be a little
standoffish around landies.

00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:46.000
Well, I've been hustling
the streets since I was 12.

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:48.435
I think I can handle
a juggling seal.

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:50.437
Oh!

00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:52.372
Sea lion.

00:37:52.507 --> 00:37:53.708
He's not from around here.

00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:55.408
But coin's a coin.

00:37:55.543 --> 00:37:58.813
Oh, no. Change...
...is a choking hazard.

00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:01.616
Well, honest mistake.

00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:03.618
Do not do that!

00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:05.318
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:06.788
Thank you, Judith.

00:38:06.921 --> 00:38:09.489
Conversing with these
beautiful sea creatures

00:38:09.624 --> 00:38:11.491
is like talking to anyone
a little different.

00:38:11.626 --> 00:38:15.295
Just takes open
and respectful communication.

00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:24.806
-Heya, bub.
-Hey, bub.

00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:26.473
-Heya, bub, hey.
-Hey, bub, heya.

00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:27.842
-Bubba, bubba, bubba.
-Bubba, bubba, bubba.

00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:29.610
-Heya, bub.
-Hey, bub. Hey, bub, bub.

00:38:29.744 --> 00:38:31.579
-Heya, bub. Bubby, bub.
-Hey, bub. Hey, bub. Hey, ho.

00:38:31.712 --> 00:38:32.680
-Heya, bub, bub.
-Hey, bub.

00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:34.649
Seen Jesús?

00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:35.817
Yup.

00:38:42.156 --> 00:38:43.925
And now we leave town.

00:38:51.398 --> 00:38:52.432
Eh?

00:38:59.874 --> 00:39:01.576
Thank you for this.

00:39:02.143 --> 00:39:03.476
Happy anniversary.

00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:04.545
Oh.

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:06.013
It's your anniversary?

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.350
♪ This is the night ♪

00:39:10.483 --> 00:39:13.420
♪ It's a beautiful night ♪

00:39:13.554 --> 00:39:19.359
♪ And we call it bella notte ♪

00:39:25.867 --> 00:39:27.735
How are we gonna
find them now?

00:39:32.907 --> 00:39:34.742
Thanks, seal.

00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:38.713
Friend. No, no, no!

00:39:38.846 --> 00:39:39.947
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:39:42.482 --> 00:39:43.951
Just a little farther.

00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:46.654
Jesús and all the answers
you'll ever need

00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:48.122
are, uh, right here

00:39:48.455 --> 00:39:51.025
at the end of this
very scary, dark hallway.

00:39:51.158 --> 00:39:52.960
Boy, this is so much better

00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:54.996
than sitting on a beach
on Outback Island,

00:39:55.129 --> 00:39:57.098
sipping piña koalas.

00:39:57.231 --> 00:39:59.834
Hmm. We are not skipping town

00:39:59.967 --> 00:40:03.070
when there is an innocent
snake out there who needs us.

00:40:03.204 --> 00:40:05.907
He's got help:
his motorcycle buddy.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.642
Ah!

00:40:07.775 --> 00:40:10.443
You are acting weird.
What is your problem?

00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:12.580
Well, A, you railroaded me.

00:40:12.713 --> 00:40:14.148
And B...

00:40:14.481 --> 00:40:15.816
...if you must know,

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:20.121
I have an aversion
to reptiles.

00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:22.056
What?

00:40:22.189 --> 00:40:25.993
Oh, is my discomfort
hilarious to you?

00:40:26.127 --> 00:40:28.829
No, you're... I'm sorry.
You're right, we are partners.

00:40:28.963 --> 00:40:30.564
And whenever
I'm uncomfortable,

00:40:30.698 --> 00:40:32.800
you are always very
considerate of my feelings.

00:40:32.934 --> 00:40:34.001
Look out! Snake skin!

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:36.469
-Ow!
-I'm slipping!

00:40:36.604 --> 00:40:37.972
I'm slipping! Hold the rail!

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:39.472
-I'm holding the rail.
-Hold it. Hold it.

00:40:39.607 --> 00:40:40.608
-Stop pulling my ears!
-Hold the rail.

00:40:40.741 --> 00:40:42.076
Never pull a bunny's ears!

00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:42.843
-Hold the rail.
-Never pull a bunny's ears!

00:40:45.146 --> 00:40:47.648
I think the real mystery

00:40:47.782 --> 00:40:49.717
is how you two
ever solved anything.

00:40:51.819 --> 00:40:53.921
Anyhoo, let's see what Jesús
has to say about your journal.

00:40:54.055 --> 00:40:56.657
Oh, and if he offers you food,
accept.

00:40:57.692 --> 00:40:59.492
Declining is a sign
of disrespect,

00:40:59.627 --> 00:41:00.695
to all of them.

00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:02.163
"All of them"?

00:41:12.974 --> 00:41:14.608
Ha!

00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:27.487
Order up.

00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:30.257
Hey, another drink.

00:41:36.864 --> 00:41:38.599
So warm.

00:41:38.733 --> 00:41:39.633
Gah!

00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:42.603
Whoops.

00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:43.771
No!

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:47.108
Keep it.

00:41:51.078 --> 00:41:53.180
Jesús!

00:41:53.314 --> 00:41:54.915
Allow me to introduce
my friends.

00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:56.817
This is Judith and Nicholas.

00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:58.185
They are wanted fugitives

00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.720
investigating a snake mystery

00:41:59.854 --> 00:42:01.022
and trying
not to get murdered.

00:42:01.155 --> 00:42:02.656
May we sit?

00:42:05.993 --> 00:42:06.961
Oh. Okay.

00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:16.137
Oh, I'm good,
but these guys look hungry.

00:42:20.341 --> 00:42:22.143
Thank you for meeting with us.

00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:25.079
We believe snakes were framed
for something in this journal,

00:42:25.212 --> 00:42:29.016
-perhaps pertaining to...
-Eat first, talk second.

00:42:29.617 --> 00:42:30.317
Oh.

00:42:55.242 --> 00:42:56.277
Uh...

00:43:06.053 --> 00:43:07.988
Hey, guys. They ate it!

00:43:09.657 --> 00:43:11.092
Look at their faces.

00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:12.726
I don't eat grubs.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.795
Hermano, get me a scone!

00:43:16.397 --> 00:43:17.865
Okay, okay.

00:43:18.899 --> 00:43:20.000
Hmm.

00:43:20.801 --> 00:43:22.203
Metal cover.

00:43:23.137 --> 00:43:24.872
And what does that mean?

00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:26.040
It means

00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:28.342
it's fancy.

00:43:29.376 --> 00:43:32.313
It also means
the secret you're looking for

00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:34.949
is probably
right on the cover.

00:43:35.082 --> 00:43:37.952
Somehow vipers can see things
in the metal,

00:43:38.085 --> 00:43:39.920
even under the paint.

00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:43.124
This is Ebenezer Lynxley's
original journal

00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:44.692
for the weather walls.

00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:48.162
Why would he hide a secret
for a snake?

00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:50.131
I don't know.

00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:53.968
But it must have been big,
'cause a tortoise died for it.

00:43:54.101 --> 00:43:57.371
I am guessing
that it was a slow death.

00:44:01.742 --> 00:44:05.079
The fanging didn't just change
how folks saw snakes.

00:44:05.212 --> 00:44:08.149
No mammals trusted
any reptile after that.

00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:12.386
That's why we all left.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.988
And that's when the Lynxleys

00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:16.957
expanded Tundratown
the first time.

00:44:18.292 --> 00:44:20.394
And it's happening again.

00:44:21.729 --> 00:44:23.797
The expansion is going here.

00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.302
Marsh Market
will be buried in snow.

00:44:28.435 --> 00:44:30.171
We'll all get pushed out.

00:44:31.105 --> 00:44:33.908
Those lynxes
will get more land,

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:36.810
and there's no way
to stop 'em.

00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:46.020
What if the secret
hidden in here could?

00:44:46.987 --> 00:44:48.289
Then I would say

00:44:48.422 --> 00:44:53.227
holding it puts the two of you
in grave danger.

00:44:55.763 --> 00:44:57.064
Ooh.

00:45:00.367 --> 00:45:02.036
They tracked you?

00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:03.871
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

00:45:04.506 --> 00:45:05.706
Whoops.

00:45:07.509 --> 00:45:09.710
It's the ZPD!

00:45:09.843 --> 00:45:12.213
Run!

00:45:12.346 --> 00:45:13.747
Leave the tails!

00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:15.316
Follow me. Come on!

00:45:18.052 --> 00:45:20.054
Wait. Why are you helping us?

00:45:20.187 --> 00:45:22.156
You two saved the city once.

00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:24.358
I reckon you can
save it again.

00:45:24.491 --> 00:45:26.260
And when you do,

00:45:26.393 --> 00:45:30.030
maybe everyone will see
we ain't that different.

00:45:34.435 --> 00:45:35.336
Huh.

00:45:36.103 --> 00:45:38.005
-Freeze!
-Yeah, freeze!

00:45:39.039 --> 00:45:40.274
I'm really sorry. But this is

00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:41.809
my family's only chance
to come home.

00:45:41.942 --> 00:45:43.010
Wait. We wanna help.

00:45:43.143 --> 00:45:44.445
Wait. Wait.

00:45:45.846 --> 00:45:47.314
Come back!

00:45:47.448 --> 00:45:49.283
There's no path.
Take the docks!

00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:50.417
Wha-- Carrots!

00:45:50.552 --> 00:45:52.319
Wait! We believe you!

00:45:52.453 --> 00:45:53.887
Nick! Come on! Come on!

00:46:02.129 --> 00:46:03.197
Ow!

00:46:05.499 --> 00:46:06.534
Grab it!

00:46:11.939 --> 00:46:13.474
Hey!

00:46:13.608 --> 00:46:16.043
I got eyes on them.
They're heading for the tubes!

00:46:16.176 --> 00:46:17.344
In pursuit.

00:46:34.295 --> 00:46:35.229
Hey, bubba.

00:46:35.362 --> 00:46:36.297
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.164
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

00:46:37.632 --> 00:46:38.499
Go!

00:46:39.433 --> 00:46:40.367
-Hey, bub.
-Hey, bub.

00:46:40.502 --> 00:46:41.435
-Bub-bye.
-Hey, Bub.

00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:42.269
-Bub-bye.
-Bub-bye.

00:46:42.403 --> 00:46:43.370
Bub-bye. Bye.

00:46:43.505 --> 00:46:44.972
-Hey, bub.
-Bub-bye.

00:46:52.212 --> 00:46:54.948
Pro tip! If he goes
for the red line,

00:46:55.082 --> 00:46:56.884
do not follow!

00:46:57.017 --> 00:46:59.253
You will run out of air!

00:46:59.386 --> 00:47:01.455
Good luck! I love you!

00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:07.061
Sorry.

00:47:08.462 --> 00:47:10.164
Cannonball!

00:47:13.033 --> 00:47:14.468
That's a red line. Red line!

00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:16.937
You're going to run out
of air! Coconut! Coconut!

00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:39.393
Anything you need, I got 'em.

00:47:39.527 --> 00:47:41.295
Sequels, prequels, requels.

00:47:41.428 --> 00:47:43.230
Who says the industry's
going down the tubes?

00:48:36.283 --> 00:48:37.251
Are you okay?

00:48:37.384 --> 00:48:39.286
Yeah. Yes.

00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:41.021
Uh, you?

00:48:41.155 --> 00:48:43.190
I... Well, I've...

00:48:43.323 --> 00:48:45.359
I feel like some...

00:48:45.492 --> 00:48:48.228
some "sorries," uh,
may be in order.

00:48:48.996 --> 00:48:51.265
Nick, it's okay.

00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:54.101
I know you didn't want to
lose him on purpose.

00:48:55.002 --> 00:48:57.705
Oh, not me sorry. No, no.

00:48:58.038 --> 00:48:59.173
You sorry.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.444
Well, now we kinda have
no way to find him

00:49:03.578 --> 00:49:04.646
or stop the lynxes,

00:49:04.779 --> 00:49:06.714
so agree to disagree.

00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:09.049
But...

00:49:09.183 --> 00:49:10.518
we are alive.

00:49:10.652 --> 00:49:13.053
So if we can't find him,
that's great.

00:49:13.187 --> 00:49:15.989
What we can find
is a truck out of here.

00:49:16.123 --> 00:49:17.191
Gah.

00:49:30.304 --> 00:49:32.973
Box of old matches. Helpful.

00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:37.077
Trudy Cabbagepatch,
leaving town. We're done.

00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:39.346
Yodelayheehoo!

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.516
Ah, dis is veird place
for you to be.

00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:42.750
Ja, very veird.

00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:44.586
Ach, zey fell out of ze tube.

00:49:44.719 --> 00:49:46.521
Okay, ve vill call police
to help!

00:49:46.654 --> 00:49:48.222
Nope! No, no, we're fine.

00:49:48.355 --> 00:49:50.357
Yep, we were
just leaving town.

00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:53.561
Actually, um,
do you happen to know

00:49:53.695 --> 00:49:55.563
where this tube goes?

00:49:55.697 --> 00:49:57.331
-Oh, Copenhoofen.
-Ja, ist Copenhoofen.

00:49:57.464 --> 00:49:58.733
Got it. Thank y--

00:49:59.066 --> 00:50:02.169
Oh, you chew too much.
This is not okay!

00:50:06.173 --> 00:50:07.407
Huh.

00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:09.544
Where did... Where did
you find these flowers?

00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:10.778
Oh, the Liebenflower?

00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:12.479
Ze tippity-top of ze mountain.

00:50:12.614 --> 00:50:13.748
Uh, zis is ze only place
zey grow.

00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:15.249
Oh, boy.

00:50:15.382 --> 00:50:16.584
Is...

00:50:16.718 --> 00:50:20.187
Uh, is there anything else
up there?

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.055
-Nope, there sure isn't.
-Oh, ja.

00:50:22.189 --> 00:50:23.591
Old Honeymoon Lodge.

00:50:23.725 --> 00:50:26.260
But is closed for long time.
Was hideout for snakes.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.097
Honeymoon Lodge.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.431
How...

00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:33.100
How do you reach it?

00:50:33.233 --> 00:50:35.469
Oh, tourists take ze tram
from Copenhoofen,

00:50:35.603 --> 00:50:38.573
but ze rope is faster.

00:50:38.706 --> 00:50:41.543
Good luck! Have fun
at ze Honeymoon Lodge!

00:50:41.676 --> 00:50:42.710
Thank you!

00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:50.652
What does the secret

00:50:50.785 --> 00:50:53.086
have to do with
the reptiles leaving town?

00:50:54.822 --> 00:50:56.758
How did it get hidden in the
journal in the first place?

00:50:56.891 --> 00:50:58.693
Will you slow down?

00:51:01.128 --> 00:51:02.630
How long do you think
it's going to be

00:51:02.764 --> 00:51:04.599
before Hoggbottom and the ZPD
figure out where we are?

00:51:04.732 --> 00:51:07.635
If anything,
we should be going faster.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.404
As I always say...

00:51:10.538 --> 00:51:13.340
I really am just a dumb bunny.

00:51:13.473 --> 00:51:14.274
Nick...

00:51:15.543 --> 00:51:17.344
I-- I-- I-- I-- I really am

00:51:17.477 --> 00:51:19.279
ju-- dumb-- dumb-- dumb--
dumb-- dumb-- dumb bunny.

00:51:19.413 --> 00:51:21.181
Just dumb-- dumb-- dumb--
dumb-- dumb-- dumb bunny.

00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:24.519
This was a gift
to symbolize our partnership,

00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:27.087
and it is not appropriate
for this moment.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.590
Oh, no, I was just...

00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:30.357
...hoping to jot down
some ideas

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:32.527
for what we will put
on our tombstones.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.429
I'll start.
"His partner did it."

00:51:35.563 --> 00:51:37.164
What happened to you

00:51:37.297 --> 00:51:38.265
that you can't just have
a normal conversation?

00:51:39.433 --> 00:51:42.570
I will save that
for my therapy animal.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.505
Yeah,

00:51:44.639 --> 00:51:46.206
-you need a therapy animal.
-Oh, yeah.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.777
Well, you need
a herd of therapy animals.

00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:54.147
Yeah. You need a whole
migration of therapy animals.

00:52:27.615 --> 00:52:28.850
Carrots?

00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:46.233
Hmm.

00:53:11.491 --> 00:53:12.927
Hey, Carrots?

00:53:19.667 --> 00:53:20.601
Huh.

00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:23.571
Ew.

00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:52.900
Uh, Carrots?

00:53:54.434 --> 00:53:55.368
Ugh.

00:53:58.973 --> 00:54:00.407
Huh?

00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.776
Carrots!

00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:33.641
There was a whole
reptile neighborhood.

00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:37.545
Their home...

00:54:40.114 --> 00:54:42.449
The lynxes just erased it.

00:54:42.583 --> 00:54:44.552
This is what they do.

00:54:44.685 --> 00:54:46.821
We have to go.

00:54:46.954 --> 00:54:50.625
They push animals out with
lies so they can have more.

00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:52.359
We gotta go.
Carrots, we gotta go!

00:54:52.492 --> 00:54:53.293
That's what
the snake's trying to prove.

00:54:53.426 --> 00:54:54.962
The ZPD is here.

00:54:55.096 --> 00:54:56.531
What?

00:54:56.664 --> 00:54:58.533
No one will believe us.
Not without proof.

00:54:58.666 --> 00:55:00.968
Leave it. They aren't gonna
just arrest us.

00:55:01.102 --> 00:55:02.069
The lynxes want us dead.

00:55:02.402 --> 00:55:03.871
We need it to solve the case.

00:55:04.005 --> 00:55:06.574
-Judy, just...
-We have to solve the case.

00:55:06.707 --> 00:55:08.408
-Nick...
-I don't care about the case!

00:55:10.144 --> 00:55:12.814
Judy,
it's not worth dying for.

00:55:15.817 --> 00:55:18.485
The world will never be
a better place

00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:21.454
if no one is brave enough
to do the right thing.

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:23.356
The world is what it is,
Carrots,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.727
and sometimes being a hero...

00:55:27.695 --> 00:55:30.631
it just doesn't
make a difference.

00:55:37.972 --> 00:55:39.073
I think, uh...

00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:44.344
I think maybe...

00:55:44.477 --> 00:55:45.613
maybe we...

00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:49.917
are different.

00:56:11.706 --> 00:56:12.773
Mmm.

00:56:24.752 --> 00:56:26.854
Oh, my gosh,
I think I just took out a cop.

00:56:26.988 --> 00:56:28.522
Uh. Sorry, sir!

00:56:28.656 --> 00:56:30.892
-Pawbert?
-Yeah. It's, uh... you know...

00:56:31.025 --> 00:56:33.527
-We're the good guys!
-I told you she's helping.

00:56:38.966 --> 00:56:40.735
Come with us.

00:56:41.502 --> 00:56:43.104
-Ow.
-We have the fox.

00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:45.773
We have the fox!

00:56:45.907 --> 00:56:47.541
They already have
your partner.

00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:50.678
They can't get you too.

00:56:50.811 --> 00:56:53.014
Please. We can stop my family.

00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:09.096
Judy!

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.065
No, no, no!

00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.802
I got you.

00:57:29.917 --> 00:57:32.086
All right. Here we go.

00:57:45.866 --> 00:57:46.968
What?

00:57:57.912 --> 00:57:59.046
Huh.

00:57:59.947 --> 00:58:02.482
You're not dead!

00:58:02.616 --> 00:58:04.518
She's not dead!

00:58:04.652 --> 00:58:06.554
Sorry, sorry.

00:58:06.687 --> 00:58:08.488
I just got
my motorcycle license.

00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:12.827
Nick?

00:58:13.627 --> 00:58:14.929
They, uh...

00:58:15.663 --> 00:58:16.931
They caught him.

00:58:20.301 --> 00:58:24.071
But out here,
no one's gonna catch us.

00:58:29.043 --> 00:58:30.911
Mayor Winddancer.

00:58:37.618 --> 00:58:38.853
Where's the bunny?

00:58:39.253 --> 00:58:40.955
I don't know.

00:58:41.088 --> 00:58:42.990
But, you know, she's a rabbit.

00:58:43.124 --> 00:58:44.992
So maybe you can
pull her out of your hat.

00:58:46.227 --> 00:58:47.661
I'm not wearing a hat.

00:58:47.795 --> 00:58:48.996
He's messing with you, sir.

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:51.098
I knew that.
Get him out of here.

00:58:52.333 --> 00:58:53.601
No.

00:58:57.638 --> 00:59:00.141
Where are they, Mr. Wilde?

00:59:03.244 --> 00:59:04.745
Begin the expansion.

00:59:04.879 --> 00:59:06.280
Freeze Marsh Market.

00:59:06.614 --> 00:59:08.182
-Flush everyone out.
-What? No, you can't--

00:59:08.315 --> 00:59:13.854
Water folk, like foxes,
are lesser mammals.

00:59:13.988 --> 00:59:16.991
If I say they helped
a dangerous snake,

00:59:17.124 --> 00:59:19.326
no one will care what we do.

00:59:21.362 --> 00:59:24.165
You're going
to a dark cell, Mr. Wilde.

00:59:24.298 --> 00:59:27.268
Just long enough
to read the headline

00:59:27.401 --> 00:59:29.703
of your partner's demise.

00:59:32.106 --> 00:59:35.976
You should've left town
when you had the chance.

00:59:44.919 --> 00:59:46.587
Dad.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.723
Fur from whoever's helping
the bunny and the snake.

00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:54.161
Find Pawbert.

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:58.265
Almost to me hideout.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.901
Snake in the hole.

01:00:01.035 --> 01:00:01.836
Ooh. Yeah, yeah.

01:00:01.969 --> 01:00:03.003
Oh!

01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:05.039
Oh!

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:07.241
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:11.145
We'll stop the Lynxleys
and save your partner.

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.314
I'm sorry. You are...

01:00:13.447 --> 01:00:15.983
Oh. Gary. Gary the Snake.

01:00:16.117 --> 01:00:17.618
And your last name?

01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:18.886
De'Snake.

01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:21.322
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:33.834
Teaming up
with you is very exciting.

01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:36.904
Ooh! Uh,
don't worry about my fang.

01:00:37.037 --> 01:00:39.373
I got my own anti-venom pen.

01:00:39.707 --> 01:00:41.242
Stops the toxin.

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:43.110
Stab me
straight into the heart.

01:00:47.715 --> 01:00:50.284
Welcome to my oasis...

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:52.319
...away from my evil family.

01:00:52.453 --> 01:00:54.955
I like to come here,
just kind of veg out.

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:56.257
Ooh!

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.392
-Get with all my cat stuff.
-Wow.

01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:01.061
-No! That's actually vintage.
-Awesome.

01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:02.863
No!
If you could just not.

01:01:02.997 --> 01:01:04.665
-Ooh!
-No! No, please don't.

01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:05.933
-Wow!
-Oh, my gosh.

01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:07.201
-Mammals get the best stuff.
-No.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:08.802
-What's this do?
-Wait, not that.

01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:12.940
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

01:01:14.742 --> 01:01:18.379
So, we should probably
get to the journal, hmm?

01:01:18.513 --> 01:01:21.415
How did you become partners?

01:01:21.749 --> 01:01:23.450
Oh, when I found out
the journal

01:01:23.784 --> 01:01:25.452
was going to be
on display at the Gala,

01:01:25.786 --> 01:01:29.123
I sent his family an anonymous
letter asking to see it.

01:01:29.256 --> 01:01:32.259
Luckily, they make Pawbert
work in the mail room,

01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:34.328
so he read it first.

01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:37.031
I got him smuggled in
from overseas.

01:01:37.164 --> 01:01:39.233
Seven days in a crate.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:42.903
But if I fix things for
my family, it'll be worth it.

01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:46.173
Then we'll fix things
for your partner too.

01:01:50.444 --> 01:01:52.246
Hey.

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:55.349
I know coming with us
was hard,

01:01:56.317 --> 01:01:58.419
but we're gonna
help your partner,

01:01:58.553 --> 01:02:00.988
the same way
we're gonna help the city.

01:02:02.056 --> 01:02:06.227
We stop my family
and show everyone the truth.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.295
Are you ready?

01:02:08.429 --> 01:02:10.364
Light the fire.

01:02:19.574 --> 01:02:22.510
How much do you know?

01:02:22.843 --> 01:02:26.447
Well, uh, that his family
was framed,

01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:29.283
and there's some secret
hidden in the metal cover

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:32.453
that only a snake can see.

01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:37.858
Not just any snake,
a heat-sensing pit viper.

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:41.795
All it takes
is a little warmth.

01:02:42.896 --> 01:02:45.966
I just... I don't understand.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.068
Why would
your great-grandfather

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:50.204
hide a secret for a snake?

01:02:50.337 --> 01:02:52.840
He didn't.

01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:54.441
I...

01:02:57.278 --> 01:02:59.313
It wasn't his journal.

01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:03.250
That's the secret.

01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:06.521
Zootopia wasn't created
by a mammal.

01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:11.025
It was created by a snake.

01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:13.360
Gary's great-grandmother.

01:03:15.496 --> 01:03:17.097
She wanted to make the city
a place

01:03:17.231 --> 01:03:19.967
where all animals
felt welcome.

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:25.039
So she invented
her weather walls

01:03:25.172 --> 01:03:27.374
to help everyone.

01:03:32.647 --> 01:03:35.082
She just needed an investor.

01:03:36.183 --> 01:03:37.418
A partner.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.121
But when my great-grandfather

01:03:41.255 --> 01:03:43.558
saw what her idea
could be worth...

01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:51.031
he plotted to steal her plans
for himself.

01:03:57.505 --> 01:03:59.574
So he committed a murder...

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:04.211
his own maid...

01:04:06.614 --> 01:04:08.982
and framed
Gary's great-grandmother.

01:04:10.685 --> 01:04:12.986
And because she was a snake,

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:15.623
everyone believed his lie.

01:04:17.224 --> 01:04:22.296
Soon, no reptiles
were welcome.

01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:24.965
And over time,

01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:26.501
my great-grandfather

01:04:26.634 --> 01:04:31.939
buried the reptile
neighborhood in snow.

01:04:34.942 --> 01:04:40.447
And he died believing no one
could ever uncover his crimes.

01:04:41.448 --> 01:04:42.550
But...

01:04:44.385 --> 01:04:46.954
he was wrong.

01:04:49.289 --> 01:04:52.960
Her original patent was saved.

01:04:54.128 --> 01:04:55.663
That's what
you're looking for.

01:04:55.996 --> 01:04:57.532
She hid it in her home.

01:04:58.499 --> 01:05:02.302
Find her home,
find her patent.

01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:14.047
We just didn't know
where her home was buried

01:05:15.149 --> 01:05:17.484
until now.

01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:20.655
My family's land?

01:05:20.988 --> 01:05:26.093
But under all that snow,
how are we gonna find it?

01:05:26.528 --> 01:05:27.461
Wait.

01:05:27.595 --> 01:05:29.129
Clock tower.

01:05:29.263 --> 01:05:31.298
Her neighborhood,
the reptile neighborhood,

01:05:31.432 --> 01:05:32.499
had a clock tower.

01:05:32.634 --> 01:05:34.334
It lights up like a beacon.

01:05:34.468 --> 01:05:37.705
If it wasn't fully buried,
maybe we could see it.

01:05:38.038 --> 01:05:39.473
Follow it to her home.

01:05:39.607 --> 01:05:41.442
Except my great-grandfather
turned off the power.

01:05:41.576 --> 01:05:43.110
But we have the plans

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:45.012
that show us
how to turn it back on.

01:05:45.145 --> 01:05:47.047
Oh! Ooh! Hmm.

01:05:47.181 --> 01:05:49.450
The power switch
to her whole neighborhood

01:05:49.584 --> 01:05:52.286
was in the original
control room.

01:05:52.419 --> 01:05:54.988
All right! And where is that?

01:05:55.122 --> 01:05:56.624
Inside the oldest wall
of the city.

01:05:56.758 --> 01:05:59.193
The Desert Tundratown
weather wall.

01:05:59.326 --> 01:06:02.296
We get inside,
turn on that switch,

01:06:02.429 --> 01:06:03.731
light the clock tower,

01:06:04.064 --> 01:06:07.968
-we find her house.
-We find her patent.

01:06:08.101 --> 01:06:11.171
And my family
is finally coming home.

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:13.373
We will succeed, Judy Hopps.

01:06:13.508 --> 01:06:16.443
We shall succeed!

01:06:18.546 --> 01:06:20.113
I found him.

01:06:21.783 --> 01:06:23.283
Get me Hoggbottom.

01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:31.158
Ooh! It's Nicholas Wilde.
Big-time cop, huh?

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.661
I'll see you
at the lunch table.

01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:36.363
I'm gonna tie your tail
in a knot.

01:06:36.497 --> 01:06:37.599
Hoggbottom--

01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:39.501
What are you looking at,
butthead?

01:06:39.634 --> 01:06:42.336
This is a mistake.
It's a setup. It's the lynxes.

01:06:42.469 --> 01:06:44.037
Listen to me. Please.

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.741
I know we have had
our differences, right?

01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:49.677
But I've always
respected you--

01:06:50.512 --> 01:06:53.113
You don't respect anyone.

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:57.384
Phone. It's Milton Lynxley.

01:06:57.519 --> 01:06:59.521
He's got
the rabbit's location.

01:06:59.654 --> 01:07:02.122
Whatever he says,
it's a lie, Hoggbottom.

01:07:02.256 --> 01:07:03.658
Hoggbottom, listen to me!

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:04.759
Oh, God.

01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:12.032
Nicholas Wilde!

01:07:13.568 --> 01:07:16.169
What are the chances?

01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:19.239
You know, this is
my first time in prison,

01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:20.642
and I gotta say,

01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:23.310
their food is on point.

01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:25.747
How are you even here?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.180
Destiny.

01:07:27.314 --> 01:07:29.383
Plus an arrest.

01:07:29.517 --> 01:07:31.485
But it looks like
Judith got away.

01:07:31.619 --> 01:07:35.623
Was that decision mutual?

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:37.357
Oh.

01:07:37.491 --> 01:07:40.595
Sensing trouble in paradise.
Wanna talk about it?

01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:43.063
What I want
is to get out of here.

01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.566
Right, your big plan.

01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:47.735
Lay low on Outback Island
sipping piña koalas.

01:07:47.869 --> 01:07:50.638
Except you can't trust koalas,
'cause they got four thumbs.

01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:53.140
Did a whole episode about it
on my podcast.

01:07:53.273 --> 01:07:55.810
It was called
"They Got Four Thumbs."

01:07:56.143 --> 01:07:58.111
But you know what? At least
they ain't platypuses.

01:07:58.245 --> 01:07:59.413
Wait. Can you just...

01:07:59.547 --> 01:08:01.516
Can you please
just let me concentrate?

01:08:01.649 --> 01:08:02.717
Roger that.

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:10.157
Just talk to me, dude!

01:08:11.726 --> 01:08:13.393
What's the last thing
she said to you?

01:08:14.662 --> 01:08:16.129
She, um...

01:08:16.263 --> 01:08:22.235
Uh, she said
maybe we are too different.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:23.805
Hmm.

01:08:23.938 --> 01:08:26.774
And what did you say
before that?

01:08:26.908 --> 01:08:29.242
I said the case
isn't worth dying for.

01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:30.344
Mmm.

01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:32.412
Like, uh...

01:08:32.547 --> 01:08:37.150
like, you know, as in it isn't
worth her dying for because...

01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:41.355
because solitary animals
like me

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:44.124
don't have real friends.

01:08:45.225 --> 01:08:48.596
And I... I...
I don't want to lose her.

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.566
So, I just...

01:08:53.367 --> 01:08:54.702
I don't know how to say that.

01:08:57.639 --> 01:08:59.741
You know what, bud?
I think you just did.

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:02.275
Wait, how'd you do that?

01:09:02.409 --> 01:09:04.144
Well, I opened my arms,

01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:06.814
put them around you
and then I squeezed.

01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:10.384
It's called a hug.
Do foxes not have hugs?

01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:12.285
Oh!

01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:14.656
The lock.
Yeah, that's Beave 101.

01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:16.758
The rabbit's in Desert Dunes.

01:09:16.891 --> 01:09:17.825
Roll out!

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.493
Hit it. Roll out!

01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:21.596
Your partner needs you,

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.264
and Nibbles Maplestick
is gonna get you to her.

01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:29.937
Hey! It's the fox dad!
And the woodchuck!

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.640
Woodchuck? I'm a beaver!
Call me that again--

01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:33.941
Oops.

01:09:34.274 --> 01:09:35.910
Okay, go! We gotta go!
Here we go!

01:09:36.744 --> 01:09:38.178
Get back here!

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:41.783
Hello, Nicholas.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.518
I hope you like my new home.

01:09:43.651 --> 01:09:45.853
I wove it with my own wool.

01:09:46.721 --> 01:09:48.188
Jump scare!

01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:53.861
Adios!

01:09:56.263 --> 01:09:59.399
Ooh-whee!

01:10:05.606 --> 01:10:06.641
We're free!

01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:10.477
-Huh.
-Wheels. We need wheels.

01:10:11.813 --> 01:10:13.280
No, no.

01:10:13.413 --> 01:10:14.682
No, no, no, no.

01:10:14.816 --> 01:10:16.450
I am sorry.

01:10:16.584 --> 01:10:19.252
I do not think we can
get to Judy in time to help.

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:20.822
Unless...

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:23.356
...you happen to know
the fastest driver

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:25.392
in the history of Zootopia.

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:44.712
Hey, Flash,
Flash Hundred Yard Dash.

01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:45.980
Partner's in trouble.

01:10:46.313 --> 01:10:47.447
Need to get across town,
ignore the laws.

01:10:47.815 --> 01:10:48.850
No...

01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:52.754
problem.

01:10:52.887 --> 01:10:54.655
Let's hit it.

01:10:56.824 --> 01:10:58.325
Hey.

01:10:58.458 --> 01:11:00.327
-Glad you're here.
-I gotta tell ya,

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.764
I'm not convinced
a sloth is our most reliable--

01:11:04.498 --> 01:11:06.701
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:11.304
To turn on the clock tower,

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:12.439
and light the way
to your great-grandma's home

01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:14.041
so we can find her patent,

01:11:14.374 --> 01:11:16.778
we need to reach the power
control room through here.

01:11:16.911 --> 01:11:18.012
But we have to move quickly
or we're never--

01:11:18.345 --> 01:11:20.615
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.282
Look, Gary,
if we don't over-prepare,

01:11:22.415 --> 01:11:24.351
we're underprepared
and I don't...

01:11:25.352 --> 01:11:26.821
My family's
been trying to prove

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:28.523
we're not what everyone thinks

01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:30.024
for a hundred years.

01:11:30.357 --> 01:11:33.027
But even this close,
they'd never want me

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.963
to put the weight of the world
on my shoulders.

01:11:36.097 --> 01:11:38.633
Because I don't have
any shoulders.

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:42.435
We shall succeed.

01:11:46.373 --> 01:11:48.308
I got you, rabbit.

01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:52.947
I cannot help Judy
if I don't know where she is,

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.849
which is why I need you
to get on Paul's computer

01:11:54.982 --> 01:11:56.483
and track Hoggbottom.

01:11:56.617 --> 01:11:58.085
You are an escaped fugitive.

01:11:58.418 --> 01:12:00.621
I could get fired
for even talking to you.

01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:02.924
They're gonna put her
to sleep! Do it!

01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:04.091
Okay!

01:12:05.693 --> 01:12:06.794
Hmm.

01:12:06.928 --> 01:12:08.896
Did you try restarting it?
Mm-hmm.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.397
Have you tried
not being an idiot?

01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:12.867
Hey, Paul.
I got you some donuts.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.434
Oh!

01:12:14.569 --> 01:12:15.903
-Oh, no!
-Thanks, Clawhauser.

01:12:16.037 --> 01:12:18.471
Clawhauser! Location!

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:23.343
Oh, no.

01:12:23.476 --> 01:12:25.546
I think we're gonna have to
go through the festival.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.814
Festival?

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.387
The phone's
the first thing they track.

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:36.356
Go! Go!

01:12:39.627 --> 01:12:41.696
-Clawhauser!
-I am working on it.

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:45.365
-I got it! No!
-Great, great, great. Now--

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:57.912
Oh. What festival is this?

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:02.650
Yeah!

01:13:05.887 --> 01:13:07.955
Move, move, move!

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:13.527
-Come on!
-Go, go, go!

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:16.396
We are with you, Judy Hopps.

01:13:17.798 --> 01:13:18.699
Ha-ha!

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.802
We meet again, Zebra.

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:25.673
-Here come the horns!
-Ow!

01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:31.012
She's going for the door.
She's going for the door!

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:33.147
Clawhauser, we're out of time.

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:35.850
I got it!

01:13:35.983 --> 01:13:37.718
Desert Tundratown weather wall
access door.

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:40.121
Desert Tundratown weather wall
access door. Hurry!

01:13:40.254 --> 01:13:43.691
-What is in that wall?
-Power control room.

01:13:43.824 --> 01:13:46.827
But for, like,
some old part of Tundratown.

01:13:46.961 --> 01:13:49.964
I know what they're
doing. They'll ruin us.

01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:55.102
No more tranquilizers.

01:13:55.236 --> 01:13:56.469
Put them down.

01:13:56.604 --> 01:13:59.140
-Sir.
-Put them down. Now!

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:04.578
Take the shot.

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.515
Take the shot! Do it!

01:14:08.816 --> 01:14:09.784
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:36.844
Judy!

01:14:41.716 --> 01:14:44.018
-Snake!
-Power control room?

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.087
Uh, five flights up.
Come on, hurry!

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.657
That is a lot of stairs.

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:53.027
Way to hustle, bud, I love ya!
I owe ya!

01:14:54.328 --> 01:14:57.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's
turning on. It's turning on!

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.736
No. Nibbles?

01:15:05.673 --> 01:15:06.907
Nibbles!

01:15:08.109 --> 01:15:10.778
Snake!

01:15:10.911 --> 01:15:12.213
Cold!

01:15:12.346 --> 01:15:14.915
It's jammed.

01:15:15.049 --> 01:15:18.219
Don't worry about me.
Find the switch.

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:19.887
No, no, no, no. Not these.

01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:22.623
It would be, uh... older.

01:15:38.873 --> 01:15:40.775
Can you see it?

01:15:40.908 --> 01:15:43.244
Did we turn on the clock
tower?

01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:48.149
There!

01:15:48.816 --> 01:15:50.151
It's there!

01:15:54.155 --> 01:15:57.291
We did it? We can find
the original patent?

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.828
Nick?

01:16:00.961 --> 01:16:02.997
The door... It's locked...
We have to...

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:04.231
How did it lock?

01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:06.767
Nibbles? Open it.

01:16:07.368 --> 01:16:09.336
Nibbles!

01:16:11.238 --> 01:16:12.973
Dang door stuck on me.

01:16:14.175 --> 01:16:15.576
Sorry.

01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:18.112
Last case
there was kind of a twist.

01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:19.680
I know.

01:16:23.684 --> 01:16:25.152
Oh, my gosh.
I really...

01:16:25.286 --> 01:16:27.621
Oh, my heart is pounding.

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:29.323
I thought you knew.
I thought you knew.

01:16:29.657 --> 01:16:30.891
-No.
-Whoa.

01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:33.260
Sorry, partner.

01:16:34.395 --> 01:16:36.831
Hate to leave you
out in the cold...

01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:39.033
...but I'm gonna.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:42.603
Please don't be mad at me.

01:16:42.736 --> 01:16:45.606
But, I mean, you get it.

01:16:45.739 --> 01:16:48.976
We've always been
on the same page. Me and you!

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.078
Underdogs, right?

01:16:51.212 --> 01:16:54.281
You gotta prove you're as good
as everyone else.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.617
That you belong.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:59.353
I know,
it's messed up...

01:16:59.687 --> 01:17:02.089
...but this is my chance.

01:17:02.223 --> 01:17:04.191
I have to take it.

01:17:04.325 --> 01:17:07.061
'Cause when I get
to his great-grandma's home,

01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:09.864
and I burn
the original patent,

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:12.700
I'll finally be something
in my family.

01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:15.936
And I'll finally belong too.

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:17.338
Judy?

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:20.207
Ruh-roh.

01:17:20.341 --> 01:17:21.775
Carrots?

01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:27.781
No loose ends.

01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:31.318
Bye, partner.

01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:36.123
Bye, Judy Hopps.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.429
Pawbert. Please.

01:17:42.763 --> 01:17:45.866
You can be different
than your family.

01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:49.436
I don't want to be different.

01:17:52.806 --> 01:17:54.742
Nick...

01:17:57.044 --> 01:17:58.746
Judy?

01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:07.321
Judy?

01:18:08.055 --> 01:18:09.323
Nibbles, do you see her?

01:18:09.456 --> 01:18:11.292
No, nothing yet.

01:18:12.527 --> 01:18:13.794
Judy.

01:18:13.928 --> 01:18:16.096
Nick.

01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:17.898
Ni...

01:18:21.035 --> 01:18:23.237
We shall succeed,

01:18:23.971 --> 01:18:25.072
Judy Hopps.

01:18:30.978 --> 01:18:33.147
It's okay. Judy sent me.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.282
She needs to find Nick.

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:40.154
Yep.
Should've seen that coming.

01:18:44.024 --> 01:18:45.492
Judy!

01:18:48.095 --> 01:18:49.897
Nick.

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:55.903
We... shall... succeed.

01:18:58.939 --> 01:19:00.140
Judy...

01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:04.745
I can't move.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.918
And you're too cold to help.

01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:13.454
And he's gonna...

01:19:14.855 --> 01:19:16.390
Nick's gonna...

01:19:16.524 --> 01:19:18.459
Judy...

01:19:18.593 --> 01:19:22.830
The world was
never meant to be

01:19:22.963 --> 01:19:26.233
on one animal's shoulders.

01:19:29.604 --> 01:19:34.174
That's why
my great-grandma wanted

01:19:34.308 --> 01:19:39.346
Zootopia to be for everyone.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:45.152
So, we could all help each
other.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.290
I didn't help.

01:19:51.225 --> 01:19:52.793
You did.

01:19:52.926 --> 01:19:57.798
You chose to help me

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:05.906
and became
my best warm-blooded friend.

01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:13.080
Very warm.

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.959
Permission to hug?

01:20:42.943 --> 01:20:47.081
We're gonna save you
and save your friend.

01:20:47.214 --> 01:20:49.584
Judy!

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:51.318
Hey, he's gonna eat
that rabbit!

01:20:51.452 --> 01:20:53.287
No, wait!
I'm saving her!

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.622
I'm gonna get her
the anti-pen.

01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:56.256
Where is she?

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:59.159
She...
She didn't make it.

01:21:00.595 --> 01:21:03.997
But with snake bites,
you go fast.

01:21:05.332 --> 01:21:06.400
You'll see.

01:21:16.343 --> 01:21:18.145
No.

01:21:23.585 --> 01:21:27.187
She's gone, Nick.
Just get it over with!

01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:42.236
You're done.

01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:45.406
Know when to quit!

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.274
Anti-venom!

01:21:47.408 --> 01:21:50.377
You can save her with the
anti-venom! Throw me the bag!

01:21:51.746 --> 01:21:53.147
Judy!

01:22:10.264 --> 01:22:12.466
Leave it!
You're gonna kill us both.

01:22:13.233 --> 01:22:15.269
It's not worth dying for.

01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:19.006
Agree to disagree.

01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:32.286
Stab me
straight into the heart.

01:23:03.283 --> 01:23:05.385
-I thought... He told me you...
-I was trying to get to you.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.087
-And I saw you...
-...that you were...

01:23:09.657 --> 01:23:13.227
I'll help your friend.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:17.331
Okay. I don't care
that we're different.

01:23:17.464 --> 01:23:19.132
You know? I...

01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:22.436
What I care about is you.

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:24.338
I care about you.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.140
Okay?

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.177
And I didn't say it.

01:23:30.812 --> 01:23:32.379
I should've said it.

01:23:32.514 --> 01:23:33.648
But I didn't

01:23:34.348 --> 01:23:35.550
because...

01:23:36.651 --> 01:23:38.520
uh, well...

01:23:38.653 --> 01:23:41.321
...'cause I am
an emotionally insecure

01:23:41.455 --> 01:23:44.124
source of your discomfort,

01:23:44.258 --> 01:23:47.094
who's not good
at expressing his feelings.

01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:50.532
Probably because I've been
on my own my whole life.

01:23:50.665 --> 01:23:52.232
It's not an excuse.
It's just...

01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:54.769
It's why instead
of telling you

01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:58.105
that you're the best thing
that ever happened to me,

01:23:58.773 --> 01:24:01.141
I-I make jokes
about your ears.

01:24:01.275 --> 01:24:02.710
And-And I tell you
that you try too hard,

01:24:02.844 --> 01:24:04.579
when, you know, the truth is

01:24:04.712 --> 01:24:07.749
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

01:24:07.882 --> 01:24:10.183
Because...

01:24:10.317 --> 01:24:12.587
Because no one else
in the world

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.523
matters more to me
than you do.

01:24:17.759 --> 01:24:20.193
I... I do try too hard
because deep down

01:24:20.327 --> 01:24:21.796
I'm afraid that I am
what everyone thinks I am.

01:24:22.129 --> 01:24:23.565
And I suppress my discomfort
because I'm worried

01:24:23.698 --> 01:24:25.332
it makes me look weak,
and I wanna be strong,

01:24:25.465 --> 01:24:26.601
and I think I'm failing
all the time.

01:24:26.734 --> 01:24:28.101
And I only take
what you say personally

01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:29.469
because you're
the only one in my life

01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:31.138
who ever believed in me,

01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:32.674
even when I don't even
believe in myself.

01:24:32.807 --> 01:24:34.642
And I
should have told you that.

01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:37.845
No one else in the world
matters to me

01:24:38.178 --> 01:24:39.413
more than you do either.

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:42.717
I have unresolved
childhood trauma

01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.151
that I refuse to discuss

01:24:44.284 --> 01:24:45.452
because being vulnerable
scares me.

01:24:45.587 --> 01:24:47.187
I make dangerous choices

01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:49.122
because I have an unhealthy
bunny hero complex.

01:24:49.256 --> 01:24:50.758
And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop.

01:24:50.892 --> 01:24:53.795
I joined because I always
wanted to be part of a pack.

01:24:53.928 --> 01:24:56.396
And the thought of losing you
scares me because...

01:24:57.765 --> 01:24:59.166
because you're my pack.

01:25:00.434 --> 01:25:01.703
I should never have left you,

01:25:01.836 --> 01:25:03.638
and I do need
a herd of therapy animals.

01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:06.239
And I should have told you
that you are the only partner

01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:10.110
-I would ever want because...
-...you're my fluffle.

01:25:10.612 --> 01:25:11.813
Mmm. Um...

01:25:11.946 --> 01:25:13.648
That's a bunch of rabbits.

01:25:15.349 --> 01:25:16.517
Hmm.

01:25:16.651 --> 01:25:19.419
Now that is what we call
an overshare.

01:25:19.554 --> 01:25:22.255
I'm alive by the way.
I made it.

01:25:22.389 --> 01:25:24.491
Oh! Also that guy
is still alive.

01:25:27.194 --> 01:25:29.463
Hey! Hey! Thief!

01:25:29.597 --> 01:25:31.599
He's gonna get to
the lost reptile neighborhood,

01:25:31.733 --> 01:25:34.134
find Gary's great-grandma's
patent and destroy it.

01:25:34.267 --> 01:25:36.403
Yeah, I've got no idea what
that means, or who Gary is,

01:25:36.537 --> 01:25:38.205
but let's go!

01:25:38.338 --> 01:25:40.273
-Hopps and Wilde?
-Wilde and Hopps.

01:25:40.407 --> 01:25:42.309
And Nibbles and Gary!

01:25:42.442 --> 01:25:43.410
He's Gary.

01:25:43.544 --> 01:25:45.613
Whoa, whoa!

01:25:45.747 --> 01:25:48.716
Thank you. It's for the snake.
He's cold. No fur on him.

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:50.417
-Why, you little...
-Bye now.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.722
-You!
-Dad!

01:25:54.856 --> 01:25:55.723
You don't belong
in this family!

01:25:55.857 --> 01:25:57.257
Wait, wait, wait! Dad!

01:25:57.391 --> 01:25:59.226
You will never
belong in this family!

01:25:59.359 --> 01:26:01.929
Wait, wait! I wasn't working
with them. I was helping us.

01:26:03.898 --> 01:26:06.433
I know where the reptile
neighborhood is buried.

01:26:06.567 --> 01:26:07.902
Where to find the real patent

01:26:08.235 --> 01:26:11.271
that proves that snakes
invented the walls.

01:26:11.405 --> 01:26:14.676
I'm going to destroy it,
for the family.

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:17.612
For you, Daddy.

01:26:17.745 --> 01:26:19.947
Uh...

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.216
You want to keep your job,
you say nothing.

01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:24.819
You!

01:26:25.553 --> 01:26:27.622
Maybe you are a Lynxley.

01:26:27.755 --> 01:26:29.222
Take me to the patent.

01:26:31.926 --> 01:26:34.327
It takes a threesome
to be somethin',

01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:37.431
but a four-way
to bust your doorway.

01:26:41.401 --> 01:26:43.538
Get to the patent! Destroy it!

01:26:45.506 --> 01:26:47.575
Go! We got this.

01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:51.746
Hey, whiskers,
you're done hurtin' muh city.

01:26:53.313 --> 01:26:54.682
Uh-oh. Tides have turned.

01:26:56.283 --> 01:26:57.451
Hey, Brian Winddancer!

01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:02.289
You want to be a hero, or
just play one on TV? Ow!

01:27:27.749 --> 01:27:29.851
Okay, I go left,
and you go right?

01:27:29.984 --> 01:27:32.019
Uh, yeah.

01:27:33.955 --> 01:27:34.989
Or...

01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:51.539
You are a horrible driver.

01:27:51.672 --> 01:27:53.306
Yes, I am.

01:28:01.082 --> 01:28:02.617
Whoa.

01:28:08.556 --> 01:28:09.924
I'm gonna jump!

01:28:14.128 --> 01:28:16.798
Zoogetherness. Huh?

01:28:16.931 --> 01:28:18.733
No, never mind.
Forget I said it. Here we go.

01:28:21.936 --> 01:28:24.071
Matches, matches,
matches, matches.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.340
Bunnies, we're burrowers.

01:28:27.474 --> 01:28:28.341
Rabbit kick. Hi-yah!

01:28:33.446 --> 01:28:34.582
I'll destroy the patent,

01:28:34.715 --> 01:28:36.884
that town
and everything in it.

01:28:37.018 --> 01:28:40.320
And a dirtbag fox
and a dumb bunny

01:28:40.453 --> 01:28:42.824
will never stand in my way.

01:28:42.957 --> 01:28:44.391
She's not a dumb bunny,

01:28:44.525 --> 01:28:46.027
and you're forgetting
one thing.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.695
What's that?

01:28:47.829 --> 01:28:48.663
We're friends with a snake.

01:28:49.697 --> 01:28:51.966
Howdy, partner.

01:28:52.099 --> 01:28:53.634
Heads up!

01:28:55.837 --> 01:28:58.940
-Daddy!
-Daddy's busy.

01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:00.875
Brian! Go!

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:03.678
You say justice is dead...

01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:05.980
...I say neigh!

01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:10.450
Ha-cha!

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.623
-Here, kitty-kitty.
-No!

01:29:15.756 --> 01:29:17.725
It's called an arrest,
sweetheart.

01:29:17.859 --> 01:29:18.893
Boom.

01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:29.103
No one
will believe you over us.

01:29:29.436 --> 01:29:31.772
We've always
been better than you.

01:29:31.906 --> 01:29:33.975
And we always will be.

01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:38.512
Nothing you do matters.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.717
Well, it matters to him.

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:45.720
Shall we?

01:30:38.572 --> 01:30:39.840
Hmm.

01:30:55.056 --> 01:30:57.191
One long sock.

01:31:29.724 --> 01:31:31.792
Oh.

01:32:38.959 --> 01:32:43.564
I'm gonna burn it all
to the ground!

01:32:43.697 --> 01:32:47.868
I'm a real Lynxley!

01:32:55.042 --> 01:32:58.712
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

01:32:58.846 --> 01:33:00.314
Astonishing news today

01:33:00.648 --> 01:33:03.751
after officers Judy Hopps
and Nicholas Wilde

01:33:03.884 --> 01:33:06.253
along with a pit viper
and a beaver

01:33:06.387 --> 01:33:08.255
foiled another
major conspiracy

01:33:08.389 --> 01:33:12.093
by revealing the true inventor
of the city's weather walls

01:33:12.226 --> 01:33:13.894
was a snake.

01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:15.596
While the now
disgraced Lynxley family

01:33:15.729 --> 01:33:17.898
were revealed to have stolen
the original plans

01:33:18.032 --> 01:33:19.667
and covered it up for decades.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.370
You have not heard the last
of Milton Lyn...

01:33:23.704 --> 01:33:25.372
Their Tundratown expansion

01:33:25.706 --> 01:33:28.242
now officially canceled.

01:33:28.375 --> 01:33:30.845
Some are calling you
the dream team.

01:33:30.978 --> 01:33:32.847
How did you do it?

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:37.985
Uh... Well, there's a lot of
different animals out there.

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:40.788
And sometimes,
we start to look

01:33:40.921 --> 01:33:43.791
at all the little reasons
that we're not the same.

01:33:44.758 --> 01:33:46.260
And it makes us worry.

01:33:48.062 --> 01:33:50.998
But maybe if
we just talked to each other,

01:33:51.132 --> 01:33:54.135
if we just tried
to understand one another,

01:33:54.268 --> 01:33:56.337
we would see
that our differences

01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:59.740
don't really make
any difference at all.

01:33:59.874 --> 01:34:05.813
Maybe we'd even see that
what makes me me and you you,

01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:09.950
can make us even stronger.

01:34:10.084 --> 01:34:13.687
And with hard work, you're
gonna get to that by year two!

01:34:15.456 --> 01:34:16.690
Zebros.

01:34:17.725 --> 01:34:19.260
Actually, my name is Gene.

01:34:19.393 --> 01:34:21.061
My name...

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.430
is also Gene.

01:34:23.764 --> 01:34:24.798
-Zebros!
-Zebros!

01:34:32.339 --> 01:34:33.374
He did it!

01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:37.178
Kids, get off the snake.

01:34:37.311 --> 01:34:39.880
Aw!

01:34:41.282 --> 01:34:43.017
Hi. How is everybody doing?

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:44.919
-Oh!
-One sec!

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.465
This is my family.

01:34:59.166 --> 01:35:00.768
Permission to hug?

01:35:05.406 --> 01:35:06.440
Thank you.

01:35:10.945 --> 01:35:13.747
Hey, uh, I got you something.

01:35:22.456 --> 01:35:24.258
Love you, partner.

01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:27.828
But I am still me, so I'm
only saying it once a decade.

01:35:27.962 --> 01:35:29.830
Love you, partner.

01:35:29.964 --> 01:35:31.298
Oh, I'm gonna need that back.

01:35:31.432 --> 01:35:33.934
I'll give it back to you

01:35:34.068 --> 01:35:35.803
There's gonna be
another case, huh?

01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:38.005
Of course. Because,
when you broke out of jail,

01:35:38.138 --> 01:35:40.741
you also released 200
highly dangerous prisoners.

01:35:40.874 --> 01:35:42.109
Worth it.

01:35:42.243 --> 01:35:44.044

where you want to start?

01:35:50.184 --> 01:35:52.086

-Shut up.

01:46:45.172 --> 01:46:46.674
