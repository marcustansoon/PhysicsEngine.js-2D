02:28.800 --> 02:32.521
I had this wondrous experience.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.441
But I didn't know how it had happened.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.927
All my thoughts turned into pictures.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.401
Beautiful!
I lay down at home in the afternoon.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.450
And then it slowly faded away.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.850
Watching these strange pictures
and feeling exhilarated.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.366
And it was... a terrible experience.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.326
Terrible because it felt as if...

04:32.520 --> 04:34.761
I was in another world,

04:34.960 --> 04:37.884
and I knew that I had a young family

04:38.720 --> 04:43.408
and now I had to go away,
had to leave that beautiful world.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.491
This was an awful,
a tormenting experience.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.289
Fear! It was the feeling...

04:58.200 --> 05:01.602
yes, of my being in another world,
I'm not...

05:01.880 --> 05:04.690
This has to be the end.
I'm on the other side.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.563
My wife came home at midnight.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.329
And the positive phase returned.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.206
I came back and...

05:23.960 --> 05:26.566
then, the next day,

05:26.760 --> 05:30.128
when I woke up, I had the feeling

05:30.520 --> 05:32.204
of entering into a new life.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.041
Of being reborn.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.369
I'd already been
to the beyond, you might say.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.442
In my consciousness,
it was almost like I'd died.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.411
Immediately, I realized,
as others did,

07:31.960 --> 07:35.931
that this was a tremendously
interesting substance for psychiatry.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.764
Your psyche and your consciousness
were altered.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.724
This was a new tool
for psychiatric research.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.171
The substance
gradually becomes effective.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.170
Meanwhile
we will record brain activity.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.729
Ready.
- Ready to start.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.606
Close your eyes.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.443
For the first ten years,
it certainly was a wonder drug.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.405
It was a very important resource
in psychiatry for patients.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.324
And I was always convinced

11:31.720 --> 11:34.530
that the real use for LSD
would still be found.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.645
It couldn't just disappear,
that was impossible.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.327
How is our consciousness created?

23:22.880 --> 23:27.488
It's created by what reaches us
through our senses.

23:27.760 --> 23:31.731
Every time we perceive something,
it makes up our consciousness.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.882
It works via our senses.
And what LSD does,

23:37.080 --> 23:42.450
how the whole mechanism works,
is that our senses are intensified,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.005
tremendously intensified.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.602
Then we see the world
in a different way.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.442
Would you like
to break off the experiment?

30:09.360 --> 30:13.649
LSD and psilocybin
are related in chemical structure

30:13.840 --> 30:16.605
to natural neurotransmitters
in our brains.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.125
They affect a part of the brain

30:21.320 --> 30:23.561
that monitors other brain areas

30:23.840 --> 30:25.205
by means of combination.

30:25.440 --> 30:32.210
This is how LSD can be highly potent
even in the smallest doses.

30:36.600 --> 30:40.969
We can establish which brain regions
these substances affect.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.287
We can localize these
psychological alterations

30:44.800 --> 30:48.725
and see which networks are active.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.841
The emotional areas
responsible for fear

30:59.200 --> 31:00.850
are, in part, muted.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.406
Others, which are responsible
for feelings of happiness,

31:05.800 --> 31:07.165
are heightened,

31:07.720 --> 31:10.929
the visual level is filled internally.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.411
So internal life
is greatly intensified.

31:17.480 --> 31:23.931
A good trip dissolves your ego
slowly and progressively.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.327
You become one with your environment,

31:28.880 --> 31:33.329
you give up control
but it can be enjoyable.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.245
You feel integrated, as one.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.287
And this gives you
a feeling of happiness.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.640
Time and space are abandoned,

31:45.840 --> 31:50.243
that's my personal view,
and you flow into the experience.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.644
You are the experience.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.890
We call it
oceanic boundlessness.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.169
These mushrooms were analysed,

32:49.960 --> 32:52.930
first in America
then in Europe, Paris

32:53.640 --> 32:57.486
to no avail: The active ingredients
couldn't be isolated.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.481
Then they thought,
there's that substance in Basel, LSD,

33:02.680 --> 33:04.364
and it has the same effects.

33:06.160 --> 33:11.849
So they asked us if we were interested
in analysing the mushrooms.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.125
That's how LSD brought this
mushroom to my laboratory.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.040
Natural science shows what exists,

33:30.920 --> 33:32.843
objectively speaking.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.326
But you still have to see it,

33:34.520 --> 33:36.170
you have to reflect on it.

33:36.400 --> 33:40.086
And a scientist sees secrets,

33:40.280 --> 33:41.850
objective secrets.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.442
And I think that a chemist

33:46.720 --> 33:49.326
who's not a mystic
is not a real chemist.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.290
He doesn't comprehend it.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.128
Mr Wasson was delighted.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.324
He told us
he'd love to take us with him

34:27.520 --> 34:30.729
to Mexico, and show us
this world of wonders.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.681
So we went on that expedition

34:39.200 --> 34:41.089
to Mazatec country in the south.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.649
My friend Gordon
explained to Maria Sabina

35:06.240 --> 35:10.404
that we'd isolated
the spirit of the mushroom.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.650
So she could carry out
her ceremony with these pills.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.968
She then organized a meeting.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.642
And when the pills
had been handed out,

35:26.240 --> 35:30.609
there was a wonderful ceremony
that lasted until the next morning.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.889
In these sacred drugs,
I basically discovered LSD.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.481
That's what makes LSD so significant.

36:15.840 --> 36:21.927
Not only due to its effect but also
because of its chemical structure,

36:22.520 --> 36:27.765
LSD belongs to these drugs that were
discovered thousands of years ago.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.964
From the infinite number of plants

36:31.360 --> 36:34.489
something had been selected
and deemed sacred.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.767
And then, and this is decisive,

36:38.120 --> 36:41.249
they were always used
in a sacred context.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.848
The Indians still use them,
they prepare, fast and pray,

36:47.520 --> 36:51.445
then come into contact with
the higher powers of another world.

46:02.520 --> 46:06.127
And then he placed an order
with the company.

46:07.080 --> 46:09.003
I don't know, maybe 200 grams...

46:09.240 --> 46:10.890
of LSD and half a kilo

46:11.320 --> 46:12.810
of psilocybin!

46:14.760 --> 46:16.410
And then he invited me

46:17.200 --> 46:20.283
to come and visit him.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.962
He said he was doing big events,

46:24.160 --> 46:26.527
big congresses and so on.

46:26.920 --> 46:29.491
So I wrote to him that
this I would not do

46:29.720 --> 46:32.326
as everything
was still being investigated.

46:32.520 --> 46:35.922
Why all this propaganda
when everything...

46:36.520 --> 46:39.569
is still developing!

49:58.440 --> 50:04.288
And then I accused him of forcing LSD
onto young people. Very young people.

50:07.120 --> 50:12.126
LSD needs preparation,
it needs a certain maturity.

50:12.800 --> 50:18.762
And it's irresponsible to
tinker with, or enter the psyches of,

50:19.040 --> 50:25.286
people who are still developing
with such an instrument as this.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.244
This I reproached him with.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.924
After my personal experiences,

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.165
I never thought a substance
with such an effect

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.328
would ever reach the streets.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.804
Yes, drug abuse.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.288
When a substance
is out there and exists,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.609
you don't
have control over it any more.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.728
Essentially,
the whole world is enchanted.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:59.170
The deeper you look into
living nature,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.243
the more wonderful
you realize it is.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.128
And I also believe you feel
that you are in good keeping there.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.330
You belong to it and you're blessed,
you can see and experience it.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:21.406
Yes, consciousness is the
greatest gift to mankind in creation.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.762
Having consciousness.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.282
That man becomes aware
of having been created.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.642
That we're aware of creation.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.283
That we're not just walking blindly
through paradise.
