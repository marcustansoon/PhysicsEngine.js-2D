1
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:50,958
- Elisabeth!
- Elisabeth!

2
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,042
We love you Elisabeth!

3
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,083
Please!

4
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,167
Over here!

5
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,417
Oh my God, we love you!

6
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,000
...my favorite.

7
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:10,333
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah, I'll get a pretzel, or something.

8
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,083
- Remember her?
- She was in that movie...

9
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,458
We're gonna have to let her know
we're gonna be late.

10
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,625
Yeah, I'll give her a text.

11
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,167
He owes me 20 bucks.

12
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,917
Get out the way!

13
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,125
<i>Vamos </i>!

14
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,125
Shit!

15
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,250
You got it!

16
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,375
Feel that power, ladies!

17
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,875
And march! Get those knees up.

18
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,042
You got it!

19
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,083
Come on!

20
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,708
Front.

21
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,042
Kick!

22
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,792
Kick!

23
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh yeah, you got it!

24
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,875
Square.

25
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,750
Think about those bikini bods.

26
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,708
You wanna look
like a giant jellyfish on the beach?

27
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Come on.

28
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,250
Cross.

29
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,042
Push.

30
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,958
Kick!
Come on, you got it!

31
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,375
Hang in there, ladies, you've got it.

32
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,542
You've got it!

33
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Great workout, ladies.

34
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,708
Alright, I hope I see you next week
for<i> Sparkle Your Life</i>.

35
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,417
We're gonna work on
the lateral abs,

36
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,875
you know,
the most difficult part to sculpt.

37
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,458
But in the meantime,

38
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,208
take care of yourself.

39
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,417
Move it back, position one.

40
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,833
Great job, ladies.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
You got it.

42
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,083
Alright take these down for me.

43
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,708
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

44
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,917
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

45
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,417
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

46
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,792
I don't care if we have to see every
fucking young girl in this fucking town

47
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,417
in the next few weeks.

48
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,583
Look, I'll make it simple.

49
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,417
We need her young.

50
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,667
We need her hot.

51
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,500
We need her now.

52
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,375
How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long,

53
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,625
that's the fucking mystery to me.

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,625
Oh, Oscar winner my ass.

55
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,292
When was that? Back in the 30s,

56
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,667
what, for<i> King Kong </i>?

57
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,417
-<i> ...promised her...</i>
- No.

58
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,375
I don't give a fuck
what we promised her!

59
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:05,083
This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

60
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,375
Find me somebody new!

61
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,083
Now!

62
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:16,958
Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease about the age of 25?

63
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,917
How old is Jennifer?

64
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,875
You better get busy!

65
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,542
<i>It's like when you see</i>
<i>someone fart on screen.</i>

66
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,833
People just love that.

67
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,250
I mean, that's just the way it is.

68
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,333
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

69
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,125
People are just people.

70
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,708
And I have to give people
what they want.

71
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,917
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

72
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,750
And people always ask
for something new.

73
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,792
Renewal

74
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,833
is inevitable.

75
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,167
And at 50...

76
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,750
well...

77
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,333
it stops.

78
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,625
What stops?

79
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,292
What?

80
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,333
What stops?

81
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,792
you know, the...

82
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,167
Oh, George!

83
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,167
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

84
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,417
Harvey!

85
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,625
George, those ratings are insane!

86
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,333
You're a genius!

87
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,333
Oh what a man, you're a genius!

88
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,583
Let's buy you a drink, come on.

89
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,750
WITH TOOTH BRIGHT
YOU GOT IT!

90
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,625
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle

91
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,708
'cause we have X-rayed
you from head to toe,

92
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,833
and you don't have so much
as a cracked molar.

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,750
So, you are good to go.

94
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,750
Vaccination, okay.

95
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,125
Not currently on any medication.

96
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,750
By the way, I just want to say, my...

97
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,042
my wife is a huge fan.

98
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
Blood type...

99
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,125
Oh hey, it's your birthday!

100
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,333
Happy bir--

101
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,583
Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry, I have to...

102
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,167
Have a good...

103
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,000
Bye.

104
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,583
One moment.

105
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,750
There's just
one last exam to perform.

106
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,667
I thought he said
I was good to go.

107
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,833
- Is there a problem?
- No, it's perfect.

108
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,833
You're a good candidate.

109
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,625
I mean, you're good to go.

110
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,958
I wish you the best.

111
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,667
Lizzie?

112
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,750
Lizzie Sparkle?

113
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,917
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

114
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,167
Fred!

115
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,750
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

116
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,833
Fred, of course!

117
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,750
You haven't changed a bit.

118
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,708
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

119
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,875
You know, I followed your career.
What a success! I mean...

120
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,583
Wow, wow, wow!

121
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,083
Wow.

122
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,208
Hey...

123
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,750
Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink some time?

124
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,083
Now that we're,
you know, "reconnected".

125
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,875
- Oh, of course,
- I'm...

126
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,875
- I'm stupid, you're super busy.
- But you know what?

127
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,333
Why don't you give me your card?

128
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,083
I mean, you never know.

129
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,042
Here...

130
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,708
This will do.

131
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,833
Don't look at my cholesterol levels,
they're a disaster.

132
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,583
- Oh, God!
- Oh, that's...

133
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,083
There.

134
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,958
Now, you've got it!

135
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,833
Call me.

136
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,167
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

137
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,083
<i>Younger.</i>

138
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,042

<i>More perfect.</i>

<i>One single injection</i>

<i>Starting a new cellular division.</i>

142
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,167
<i>That will release</i>

<i>The Substance.</i>

145
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,417

<i>One week for one.</i>

151

<i>And one week for the other.</i>

152

<i>A perfect balance of seven days each.</i>

153

<i>You can't escape from yourself.</i>

156
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:24,083
<i>You slip through my fingers</i>

157
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,833
<i>And you drop to the ground</i>

158
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,208
<i>You fade away</i>

159
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,083

00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,958
<i>Write this down,</i>
<i>35 North Byron Alley.</i>

170
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,583
35 North...

171
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,208
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

172
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,583
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

173
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,458
<i>And everything is you.</i>

174
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,917
<i>This is simply</i>

175
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,833
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

176
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,000
Hello.

177
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:58,792
Thanks.

178
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,125
We'll let you know by next week.

179
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,458
Thank you so much.
I'm just dying to get the part.

180
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,417
Great dancer.

181
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,833
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle
of her face instead of that nose.

182
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,042
Next!

183
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,500
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

184
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,750
Please say your name,
age, measurements.

185
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:54,958
I'm...

186
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,375
Sue.

187
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,167
<i>I'm Sue.</i>

188
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,833
<i>Sue. Sue. Sue...</i>

189
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,500
Where is she?

190
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,417
Where is she?

191
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,250
What a gorgeous

192
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:35,000
little

193
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,292
angel!

194
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,625
You're hired.

195
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,500
We want a show

196
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,583
that's just like you.

197
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,917
Beautiful and happy.

198
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,208
People want to be happy.

199
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,500
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

200
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,875
I'm gonna let you organize
the rest with my assistant...

201
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,792
Isabella.

202
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,500
Isa, Isa, Isa...

203
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,875
who has time to say that?

204
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,042
We're gonna make you Cindy.

205
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,208
It's shorter.

206
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,667
It's better.

207
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:20,750
So, I'm gonna let you organize
everything else with Cindy.

208
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,708
Before you go,

209
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,833
I just have to mention a...

210
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,875
small scheduling issue.

211
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,750
I have to be

212
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,417
out of town every other week.

213
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,667
To take care of my mother.

214
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,292
Who's very sick.

215
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:49,167
I want you for this show.

216
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:52,458
And we will work around
any mother, brother,

217
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,167
fucking sick puppy

218
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,042
you need to take care of.

219
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,000
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

220
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,708
People are gonna love that.

221
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,125
Perfect.

222
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:04,792
So you jump out.

223
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,958
Touch your elbows.

224
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,500
Head

225
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,542
down.

226
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,000
Contract.

227
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,333
And five, six, seven, eight.

228
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,583
Elbows.

229
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,333
There she is!

230
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,417
Where have you been?

231
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:58,083
We've all been wanting to have
a drink with you for your departure.

232
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,000
Anyway...

233
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,833
we all chipped in,

234
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,208
and we got you just a little something.

235
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,208
To keep you busy.

236
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:09,833
It's French.

237
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,833
My wife, she swears by it.
Oh, I love my wife.

238
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,000
Oops, I gotta run.

239
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,375
But it's always great to see you.

240
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,125

254

<i>I cannot believe the incredible price.</i>

255
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,208
<i>For $49.98, shoppers.</i>

256
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:54,208
<i>Look at the quality of this thing.</i>
<i>This thing is sturdy.</i>

257
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,583
<i>Beautiful.</i>

258
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,042
<i>Listen to your music at home, shoppers.</i>

259
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,458
<i>$49.98, I'll take one myself.</i>

260
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,583
<i>Put it right there,</i>

261
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:03,500
<i>hold that one for me,</i>
<i>that one's mine.</i>

262
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,792
<i>How can you ever--</i>

263
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:38,292
<i>God damn it, lady, come on!</i>
<i>I haven't slept in three nights!</i>

264
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,167
<i>Open up! God damn it!</i>

265
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,625
Are you gonna open--

266
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Sorry.

267
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,667
I thought that Ms. Sparkle...

268
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,167
She moved out.
I'm the new tenant.

269
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:54,542
Sue.

270
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,375
Oler--

271
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,542
Oler--

272
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,333
Oliker.

273
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,625
You wanted to complain
about something...

274
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,708
Oliver?

275
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,708
What?

276
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:07,958
No.

277
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:09,875
No, no, no...

278
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,667
I think it's awesome when there's stuff
going on in the building.

279
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,458
You know what I mean?

280
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,750
I'm actually...

281
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,417
quite handy.

282
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,875
If you ever need...

283
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,833
need me to be of aid in any way.

284
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,208
I got a sack of tools, and...

285
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,000
I got a big hammer.

286
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:35,917
You know what I mean.

287
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,208
Anyways, I live right here.

288
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,042
So you know where to find me.

289
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,458
Anytime.

290
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,375
Day or night.

291
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,833
Later.

292
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,250
Hi everybody.

293
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:44,792
I'm Sue.

294
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,042
And it's time

295
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,208
to pump it up!

296
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,083
Are you ready?
Let's go.

297
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,833
Thank you so much, everybody.

298
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,333
I'll see you next week.

299
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:24,875
Oh...

300
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:27,917
And in the meantime...

301
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,750
take care of yourself.

302
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,083
Where is she?

303
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,250
There she is!

304
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:44,625
Wonderful, wonderful.

305
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,375
That's what I'm talking about!

306
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,542
I won't be out late,
so just wait for me.

307
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,208
Don't eat too fast.

308
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,333
Let's go!

309
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,000
Are you alright?

310
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,917
Yes, I'll be right back.

311
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,375
Are you alright?

312
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:58,708
What did you do?

313
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:01,167
You seem
even more beautiful than before.

314
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,458
<i>Yes?</i>

315
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,125
Yes, hi.

316
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:40,958
This is Elisabeth Sparkle.

317
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,292
I'm 503.

318
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,125
<i>Yes.</i>

319
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:52,083
Yes, hi.

320
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:54,958
There's been a slight

321
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,000
misuse of the Substance.

322
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,125
A few extra hours were accidentally

323
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,667
used.

324
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,333
Causing um...

325
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,333
an alteration.

326
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,917
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

327
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>What has been used on one side</i>
<i>is lost on the other side.</i>

328
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,042
<i>There's no going back.</i>

329
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,750
No...

330
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,542
I don't know what she was thinking.

331
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,042
And obviously she was drunk.

332
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:32,792
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>there is no "she" and "you".</i>

333
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,292
<i>You are one.</i>

334
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,625
<i>Respect the balance.</i>

335
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,292
<i>And you won't have</i>
<i>any more inconveniences.</i>

336
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,708
Sue!

337
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,417
Sue?

338
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,042
I just saw you on TV.

339
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,125
Holy moly!

340
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,417
Makes me wanna join your class.

341
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,792
You don't give private lessons,
do you?

342
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,250
Hey, um...

343
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:37,083
What about a drink
at my place tonight?

344
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,000
Come on, don't be shy.

345
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,958
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

346
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,333
Alright.

347
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,833
Take your time.

348
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,333
But it's a date.

349
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,667
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

350
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,833
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

351
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:57,833
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

352
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:00,042
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

353
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:25,333
What can I get you?

354
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,750
Mocha latte.

355
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,667
It's long, isn't it?

356
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:44,708
Excuse me?

357
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,417
Seven days.

358
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,458
Did you follow me here?

359
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:25,000
I was just curious

360
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,625
to find out how things
were going for you.

361
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:31,625
Each time, you feel a little more...

362
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,292
lonely.

363
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:35,333
Don't you think?

364
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

365
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,917
I'm fine.

366
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,667
Everything's fine.

367
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,792
It gets harder each time

368
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,208
to remember that you

369
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,958
still deserve

370
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,667
to exist!

371
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,333
That this part of yourself

372
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,958
is still worth something,

373
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,625
that you

374
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,458
still matter!

375
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,083
Has she started yet?

376
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:15,125
Eating away at you?

377
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:33,333
Fuck!

378
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,750
Watch out!

379
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,375
What?

380
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,083
Hey!

381
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,250
Move!

382
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:31,458
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

383
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:42,292
<i>Hello?</i>

384
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,042
Hi, Fred.

385
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,458
It's Lizzie.

386
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:49,708
Hello?

387
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,083
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock.</i>

388
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,292
<i>Wow, wow, wow!</i>

389
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,333
<i>I thought I'd never</i>
<i>hear from you again after...</i>

390
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,875
Oh gosh, no, not at all.

391
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:01,500
I've just, I've just...

392
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:03,708
I've just been really busy lately.

393
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,208
So listen,

394
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,792
I was thinking that...

395
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:13,000
maybe we could get together
and grab a drink?

396
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,625
Are you still there?

397
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,958
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock again.</i>

398
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,250
<i>I could book Luigi's at 8?</i>

399
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,083
Eight at Luigi's it is.

400
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,667
I...

401
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,958
I will see you tonight.

402
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,875
-<i> Bye.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

403
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,750
<i>And we're back!</i>
<i>And welcome back to...</i>

404
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:36,917
<i>Bob and Judy, are you ready?</i>

405
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,167
Hi everybody!

406
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,667
Okay, here we go everyone,
clear the set, please.

407
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,500
First positions, thank you.

408
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:50,833
Roll cameras.

409
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,125
And in

410
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:53,500
Three, two...

411
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,208
one...

412
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,208
And squat, squat, squat.

413
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,208
Circle those hips.

414
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,000
Circle those hips.

415
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,917
Contract, contract, contract.

416
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:11,042
Contract, contract, contract.

417
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:13,000
Head between your legs!

418
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:20,167
Cut!

419
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:25,167
I'm sorry, I thought I...

420
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:28,417
I thought I...

421
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,000
I just got distracted.

422
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,208
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

423
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,000
Back to one, please.

424
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,542
Sorry, it's the control room now.

425
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:42,000
The director said he saw
something bizarre on the monitor.

426
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:43,792
Bring up the replay on camera 2.

427
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,083
Camera 2!

428
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,167
Forward.

429
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:04,292
Can I have my dressing gown?

430
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,125
- Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
- Well then, go and get it!

431
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,208
Let's just take this frame by frame.

432
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:24,750
I need five minutes.

433
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:25,958
-<i> Yes?</i>
- This balance is not working!

434
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,375
I barely have any time
to enjoy myself.

435
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:31,333
While she wastes seven days,

436
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:33,167
stuffing her face in front of the TV!

437
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,250
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>there is no "she" and "you".</i>

438
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,417
<i>You are--</i>

439
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,708
Hello everybody...

440
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,000
What's happening?
Where is everybody?

441
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,667
The taping's been cancelled.

442
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:50,708
What? Why?

443
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:51,875
Sue.

444
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,583
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

445
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,458
Okay.

446
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:57,750
I'll go change...

447
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,375
No, he said "Now".

448
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,625
I'll get right to the point.

449
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,750
We can't keep you
on the morning show.

450
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,208
But why? I just started.

451
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,208
Ratings are through the roof.

452
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:31,167
We started at 42.

453
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:33,000
Now we're up to, like...

454
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,000
216.

455
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:37,458
It's phenomenal!

456
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,083
People love you!

457
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:42,292
They adore you!

458
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:44,042
They want more and more

459
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:45,500
and more of you.

460
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,417
That is why we have decided

461
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,333
that we want you to host

462
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:53,292
the New Year's Eve show.

463
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,292
You mean the...

464
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:58,417
The network's biggest show.
50 million viewers.

465
01:21:58,583 --> 01:21:59,750
Live.

466
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:02,083
You can't go higher than that!

467
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,417
Now, it's gonna be intense.

468
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,250
We only have a few months
to pull it off, so...

469
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,542
Are you in?

470
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,583
If you don't open the door
when opportunity knocks

471
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,000
you won't get another chance.

472
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,375
You of all people know this.

473
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,167
Just one more day,
and then I have a whole week off

474
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,583
we can switch.

475
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,792
We're doing the cover of Vogue!

476
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,583
Just one more day, okay?

477
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,250
No...

478
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:15,750
<i>Yes?</i>

479
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,833
She didn't respect the balance!

480
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,125
She's stealing
more and more time from me.

481
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:25,042
Completely without consideration
to the consequences.

482
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,792
She's a selfish bitch!

483
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:27,875
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

484
01:24:30,917 --> 01:24:32,000
Stop?

485
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,458
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

486
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:37,042
<i>If you are not satisfied,</i>
<i>you can put an end to the experience</i>

487
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:40,083
<i>and go back to being just you,</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

488
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,292
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

489
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,875
Will it go back
to the way it was before?

490
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,208
<i>What has been transferred</i>
<i>won't come back.</i>

491
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:51,708
<i>But you can stop</i>
<i>the experience as of now.</i>

492
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,208
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

493
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:56,125
<i>To go back to being just you,</i>
<i>on your own?</i>

494
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,083
No.

495
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:03,833
No, no, no...

496
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,500
I can't stop.

497
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:07,667
She...

498
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,750
I...

499
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:18,458
The balance
just needs to be respected.

500
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,958
<i>So respect it.</i>

501
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,250
Just stop it. Stop it.

502
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,375
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

503
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,875
<i>Bob, you are the winner!</i>

504
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,833
<i>So Bob, congratulations,</i>
<i>you've won $25,000.</i>

505
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:44,250
<i>Now you have one final chance</i>
<i>to answer a single question</i>

506
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:48,833
<i>in our big question round</i>
<i>and play for $250,000!</i>

507
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,083
<i>Now, you'll have just 45 seconds...</i>

508
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,750
Just a little something
to keep you busy.

509
01:27:08,542 --> 01:27:09,958
Fuck...

510
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,833
<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>she is here.</i>

511
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:40,500
<i>The superstar</i>

512
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:42,833
<i>of the moment, Sue!</i>

513
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,917
<i>Are you ready? Let's welcome her!</i>

514
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,250
<i>Sue!</i>

515
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:53,000
You popped up out of nowhere
on our screens like a tornado!

516
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,875
I don't think anybody

517
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,625
was really prepared for this whirlwind.

518
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:07,208
It all started with the morning show.

519
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,625
And rumor has it,

520
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:12,208
that you are up
for Tom Grant's next movie.

521
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,250
<i>Ah, wait...</i>

522
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:16,542
just a moment.

523
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,875
I'm being told
you are going to host

524
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,667
the New Year's Eve show,
can you confirm this?

525
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,250
Yes, that's right.

526
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:24,875
Yes, that's right.

527
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:30,458
Oh my God! That is huge news!

528
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,833
<i>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</i>

529
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,458
Where are you from,
how did you get discovered?

530
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,875
I want, we want to know everything.

531
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:45,083
Well, I mean..

532
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:48,000
there's really not very much to tell.

533
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,833
I'm just a girl

534
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:53,583
from a very small town in Indiana.

535
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,542
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

536
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:57,750
In fact, it's not even a town.

537
01:28:57,792 --> 01:29:00,875
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village. It's...

538
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,625
a farm, perhaps?

539
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,000
<i>But, ever since I can remember,</i>

540
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:13,875
it has always been my dream

541
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:15,250
<i>to be on the screen.</i>

542
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,958
This is my dream.

543
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:20,042
As a child I used to put
on shows for my family.

544
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,333
Your family.

545
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,583
How sweet.

546
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,542
<i>So...</i>

547
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:30,083
everyone is aware

548
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,708
that you replaced

549
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,417
Elisabeth Sparkle.

550
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:37,708
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

551
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,375
you turned up the volume,

552
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:41,583
and you rocked their world.

553
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,500
Were you a fan of her show?

554
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:51,125
Well...

555
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,083
Well, I can't...

556
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,125
I can't really say
that I actually watched

557
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,292
<i>her show.</i>

558
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:02,458
You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

559
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:05,000
And you have to admit

560
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,500
it was a bit old-fashioned.

561
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:10,958
Jurassic Fitness, really.

562
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,333
Jurassic Fitness?

563
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,667
It needed a change.

564
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:18,333
I'll fucking show you.

565
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,583
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

566
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:26,000
<i>You want it?</i>

567
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:27,917
Come on,

568
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:30,500
come get
your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

569
01:30:39,292 --> 01:30:41,458
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

570
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:45,500
So every morning,

571
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,042
rain or shine,

572
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:50,250
<i>Sparkle Your Life </i>was on TV.

573
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,500
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

574
01:30:52,792 --> 01:30:54,375
Whether I liked it or not.

575
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,292
I guess that's why you can say
we have some sort of connection.

576
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,167
"Some sort of connection."

577
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:01,542
You wouldn't exist

578
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:02,875
without me.

579
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:16,167
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

580
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,583
for our final question.

581
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,542
The question that we ask

582
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:24,708
each and every one of our guests.

583
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,667
Would you share one of your little

584
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,042
beauty secrets with us?

585
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,542
Just one little trick of yours

586
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:37,125
that helps you look so incredibly
stunning, I mean, look at you.

587
01:31:37,167 --> 01:31:38,875
- I don't know...
- Say it!

588
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,250
Say it!

589
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,833
- Let me think.
- Say it.

590
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:46,250
Tell them
who your little beauty secret is.

591
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,333
I guess...

592
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:49,625
Why don't we just show them right here?

593
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:51,292
Here's your little beauty secret.

594
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:53,083
<i>I guess I just try to be myself.</i>

595
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,250
<i>To be sincere</i>

596
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:56,542
<i>and grateful for all that I have.</i>

597
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,208
<i>And to always remember
to lead with my heart.</i>

598
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:02,083
<i>America's sweetheart.</i>

599
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,583
"I just...

600
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,042
I try to be myself."

601
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:18,792
Stop it!

602
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:21,333
Stop it.

603
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:23,250
You're taking it from me.

604
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:25,583
That's your little secret.

605
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,292
Stop it!

606
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,292
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

607
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,208
You have to...

608
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,458
...control yourself!

609
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:07,958
I can't go back inside her.

610
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:17,542
Gross, old,

611
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:18,917
fat,

612
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:20,750
disgusting!

613
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:42,667
Coming to bed?

614
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,375
Yes.

615
01:34:45,167 --> 01:34:46,458
I'll be right there.

616
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,833
-<i> Yes?</i>
- Hi!

617
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:54,667
Hi, this is an emergency.

618
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:56,750
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

619
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,042
Hello?

620
01:36:01,292 --> 01:36:02,875
It's fucking 503.

621
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,042
Yes.

622
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,625
I'm telling you, this is urgent.
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

623
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:09,667
<i>It means you've reached the end.</i>

624
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:13,250
What do you mean, the end?

625
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:14,917
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

626
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,125
<i>If you want more,</i>

627
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:18,042
<i>you must let the fluid regenerate.</i>

628
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,208
Tell me how to do it,

629
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,500
I need to stabilize myself right now.

630
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,500
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

631
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,500
Excuse me?

632
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:31,208
<i>The switch reboots</i>
<i>the fluid secretion process</i>

633
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,833
<i>so you can continue</i>
<i>to enjoy the experience.</i>

634
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,833
No, no, no.

635
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,542
I can't switch, I can't.

636
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:39,625
Especially not now.

637
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,542
<i>There is no other option.</i>

638
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,292
Sue?

639
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:22,708
Babe?

640
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:26,833
Sue?

641
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,500
You alright?

642
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,708
Stressed out about tomorrow?

643
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:58,167
Sue? Is something wrong?

644
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:05,542
You a little cranky because
of your lady business?

645
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:11,333
Sue, open the door.

646
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:13,833
Come on, Sue.

647
01:38:14,417 --> 01:38:16,292
It's not funny,
I need to take a piss.

648
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:18,875
Sue, open the door.

649
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:21,500
Open the door, Sue. Come on.

650
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:24,167
Babe.

651
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:28,375
Open the door.

652
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,333
Sue...

653
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,333
Open the door!

654
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,542
Get out!

655
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:54,500
What the fuck?

656
01:38:55,458 --> 01:38:57,333
Get the fuck out!

657
01:38:57,667 --> 01:38:59,792
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

658
01:38:59,917 --> 01:39:01,208
And leave me alone!

659
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,958
What the fuck!

660
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,292
<i>Yes?</i>

661
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,083
I...

662
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,000
It's 503,

663
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,792
and I want to stop.

664
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:17,250
<i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

665
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:19,000
I wanna stop!

666
01:40:19,167 --> 01:40:21,375
I wanna fucking stop.

667
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,583
I wanna stop!

668
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,250
<i>We'll deliver.</i>

669
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,292
Sue? I--

670
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:14,500
Fuck off!

671
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,083
<i>Are you sure?</i>

672
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:41,000
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

673
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:43,958
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

674
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:47,000
<i>Just on your own.</i>

675
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,917
<i>Just on your own.</i>

676
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:52,125
<i>On your own...</i>

677
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:53,167
Shut the fuck up!

678
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,792
<i>On your--</i>

679
01:43:43,292 --> 01:43:44,625
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

680
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:45,833
<i>We love you!</i>

681
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,667
<i>Over here!</i>

682
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:51,375
<i>We love you!</i>

683
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:57,417
I can't.

684
01:43:58,792 --> 01:43:59,833
I can't.

685
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,167
I can't do this.

686
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,667
I need you.

687
01:44:07,249 --> 01:44:08,417
Cause...

688
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:10,417
I hate myself.

689
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:15,042
You gotta...

690
01:44:15,292 --> 01:44:16,667
you gotta get ready,

691
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,333
it's our big,
it's our big night.

692
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:22,708
Come on, they're gonna
love you so much.

693
01:44:23,917 --> 01:44:24,958
Come on.

694
01:44:26,167 --> 01:44:27,167
Come on.

695
01:44:27,292 --> 01:44:28,458
One, two...

696
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:30,208
you're the only lovable part of me,

697
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,958
you have to come back.

698
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:33,208
You have to come back!

699
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:34,583
Come back...

700
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,292
Come on.

701
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:02,125
Come on.

702
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:09,667
Come on!

703
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:14,333
Got an hour and a half
for makeup. Hair...

704
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,208
And then we gotta get you
to the fitting room, into your dress.

705
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:19,042
After that we have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

706
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:20,542
We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

707
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:21,792
You got it?

708
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:23,000
Okay, let's go.

709
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:24,125
Come on.

710
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:31,958
The dress.

711
01:51:32,583 --> 01:51:33,958
Wonderful!

712
01:51:34,458 --> 01:51:35,500
Perfect!

713
01:51:43,458 --> 01:51:44,958
And here you go...

714
01:51:52,708 --> 01:51:53,708
Good.

715
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,333
Can we get the dance light?

716
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,333
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

717
01:53:28,417 --> 01:53:31,417
Sue. They need to see you on stage
to set the lights.

718
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,583
Huh?

719
01:53:55,417 --> 01:53:56,917
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

720
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,375
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

721
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:02,667
<i>More beautiful,</i>

722
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,542
<i>more perfect...</i>

723
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:05,708
Sue?

724
01:54:07,542 --> 01:54:09,125
Yes, let me meet you there.

725
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:11,167
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

726
01:54:27,917 --> 01:54:28,958
Sue.

727
01:54:32,333 --> 01:54:34,750
Let me introduce you
to the shareholders.

728
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:38,042
They have been dying to meet you.

729
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,875
Is everything...

730
01:54:44,125 --> 01:54:45,458
okay?

731
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:51,417
So, smile!

732
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:01,542
It's what we want tonight!

733
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:06,083
Pretty girls should always smile.

734
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:09,167
Girls, come on.

735
01:55:09,375 --> 01:55:10,750
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

736
01:55:12,792 --> 01:55:14,042
Come on, we gotta go.

737
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,625
Tiffany, Cindy, Ashley.

738
01:55:18,792 --> 01:55:20,042
Go, go, go!

739
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:22,500
Feathers! Feathers! Feathers!

740
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:15,750
Hey, ready for tonight?

741
01:57:05,583 --> 01:57:07,375
I need a better version of myself.

742
01:57:07,542 --> 01:57:10,292
Please give me
a better version of myself, please.

743
01:57:16,167 --> 01:57:17,667
Please!

744
01:57:19,375 --> 01:57:21,125
Come on!

745
01:59:15,333 --> 01:59:19,333
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

746
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:22,332
<i>Please say your name,</i>

747
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,000
<i>age, measurements.</i>

748
01:59:27,333 --> 01:59:28,625
I'm...

749
01:59:34,792 --> 01:59:36,167
I'm...

750
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:21,917
Pretty girls

751
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,625
should always smile.

752
02:02:59,458 --> 02:03:02,708
At last, we were starting to worry.
Hurry up, you're up in five.

753
02:03:21,417 --> 02:03:23,708
There she is, so beautiful.

754
02:03:24,792 --> 02:03:26,125
We love you!

755
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:29,333
This is where you belong,

756
02:03:29,375 --> 02:03:30,917
and you'll always belong here.

757
02:03:31,082 --> 02:03:32,375
We can't do it without you.

758
02:03:32,542 --> 02:03:33,958
We could never do it without you.

759
02:03:34,875 --> 02:03:36,542
You're irreplaceable.

760
02:04:04,792 --> 02:04:06,875
Girls, come on, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

761
02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:08,125
Alright, come on, everybody.

762
02:04:08,208 --> 02:04:09,417
Let's go, let's go.

763
02:04:13,167 --> 02:04:15,625
You will not be disappointed.

764
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:18,333
She's my most beautiful creation.

765
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,917
I have shaped her for success.

766
02:06:13,625 --> 02:06:16,000
I'm so happy

767
02:06:16,083 --> 02:06:18,750
to be with you tonight.

768
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:24,792
I've missed you all

769
02:06:24,917 --> 02:06:27,417
so much!

770
02:07:27,792 --> 02:07:29,333
The monster!

771
02:07:37,542 --> 02:07:38,958
Shoot the monster!

772
02:07:40,417 --> 02:07:41,417
It's a freak!

773
02:07:41,708 --> 02:07:42,750
No!

774
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:45,083
Shoot the monster!

775
02:07:45,792 --> 02:07:46,875
Don't be scared

776
02:07:47,042 --> 02:07:48,125
Monster!

777
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:49,667
It's still me.

778
02:07:49,917 --> 02:07:51,125
It's me!

779
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,083
I'm Elisabeth.

780
02:07:53,125 --> 02:07:54,083
I'm Sue!

781
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:00,875
Freak!

782
02:08:03,167 --> 02:08:05,292
You freak!

783
02:08:08,167 --> 02:08:09,958
Monster!

784
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:14,375
Freak!

785
02:08:15,958 --> 02:08:17,625
Monster!

786
02:08:21,042 --> 02:08:22,458
It's me!

787
02:08:24,375 --> 02:08:25,958
Just me.

788
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:36,500
I'm the same.

789
02:09:31,292 --> 02:09:33,792
<i>Too bad her boobs aren't</i>
<i>in the middle of her face</i>

790
02:09:33,833 --> 02:09:35,708
<i>instead of that nose.</i>

791
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:39,625
<i>Next!</i>

792
02:09:45,707 --> 02:09:49,000
<i>Pretty girls should always smile.</i>

793
02:09:54,292 --> 02:09:56,792
<i>At 50 it stops.</i>

794
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,292
So beautiful!

795
02:13:00,208 --> 02:13:01,417
We love you!

796
02:13:04,125 --> 02:13:06,084
You're irreplaceable!
